*Came into the session around 10.20am


Paragraph 20
India
: No value in stocktaking prior to 2020 as there will be no efforts before 2020
China
: Prefer to move discussion to different section (Workstream 2)
Iran
: Very polite to USA, let the
m go firs
t
USA
: Support early review of what is happening
Iran
: Does not support as
it
does not serve any purpose. Support China and Canada. Discussion should be moved to workstream 2
EU
: Doesn’t interpret as parties having to submit new INDCs before 2020, just want’s to ensure regular meeting.
Singapore
: Could do away with option 3.
EU
: Open to deleting option 3.
Tuvalu
: Wants to put brackets last clause. Adding brackets shows that we have made progress.
Saudi
: Position to go with option 2. Championing developing countries (don’t want to force DCs to convert INDCs to NDCs) but speaking as a wealthy country.
Chair
: Hopes Saudi had a good night last night.
NZ
: See’s INDCs disa
p
pearing NDMCs. Not practical to meet too far in advance. Sceptical about pre 2020 meeting. Doesn’t want option 3 deleted until explanation of disappearing text.
After 30 minutes no change to P20.
India
: Supports dropping option 3 and moving option 1 discussion to workstream 2
Korea
: Supports moving discu
s
sion to workstream 2
Saudi
: Gets worked up and speaks of capacity issue of developing countries, but starts off also wishing the Chair a good night
’
s sleep.
Nicaragua
: Need plan B, so the fate of Mother Earth isn’t placed on this voluntary INDC mechanism. Highlights historical responsibility not universal responsibility. Presenting alternative proposal. Asking IPCC for a range of new reports highlighting historical responsibilities.
Chair
getting annoyed.
Chair
welcomes Sudan to his side of the room. Wasn’t used to them sitting so close.
Still no change in P20 text…
Sudan
supports deleting Option 3
Marshall Islands
: Supports Nicaragua in that this agreement must get us to where we need to get to (ie 1.5
°
)
Indonesia
: Supports delete Option 3
,

Nicaragua
: Supports proposal by Marshall Islands to include future implications

Chair
: Going to delete Option 3, Asking for parties to come back with reformulation of Option1



Moving to P21


Chair,
not sure what
’
s realistic about timeframe of IPCC or 6th assessment report.
Tuvalu:
Purpose to facilitate discussion of emissions pathways and impacts of 1.5
°
.
Guatemala:
He worked on IPCC report. 6th Asses
s
ment report due to start 2016 ready 2020. 0.5
°
change is too small to see significant change so would recommend 2 or 3
°
.
Nicaragua:
Calls on cap for temperature rise of 1.5
°
EU:
Clarifying, there is a lack of science on pathways for 1.5
°
or less.
Iran
: Does not see much point in keeping this P. IPCC already produces reports and this info will be included in 6th asses
s
ment report.
US:
Echos Guatemala, proposes bringing someone in from IPCC to talk about this and ensure it is necessary. Question is how do we get more information on 1.5
°
. IPCC just assesses current lit, if this is not available then special report not possible. Need to ask scientific community to look at this. Prob not possible to do this in time frame anticipated.
Tuvalu:
Critical for LDCs, we have had indications of impacts of 1.5
°
but time lag in information since Assessment report 5, expects there is new research on this. Implications of information are not for IPCC so shouldn’t be concerned where this leads too.
Singapore:
Need to consult IPCC on what is possible. Need report to be objective and when requesting be careful about language to not force result.
Saudi Arabia:
Let’s recognise we would not exist without IPCC ie 1st AR in 1990 preceding COP1. Are we telling IPCC they don’t know what they are doing, that they didn’t know what they are doing. If they had
l
it available they would have looked at it. Do we think they are waiting for us?? They are leading us. “Do not muddy their work, do not tell them what to do, they are doing a good job for humanity”
China:
Should be careful before requesting something that may be impossible.
EU:
Must be someone from IPCC in the building?? They should come in and chat to us.
Tuvalu:
Would like to retain request. Doesn’t think suggestion to defer is helpful.
Chair:
Will get someone from IPCC, time to move on.

Moving to P17/18

Tuvalu
: Has concern that 17ter implies all developing countries have done INDCs. Qualify reference to developing countries, some/many but not all.
Chair
: No further proposals to P18. P17bis deferred

Turning to 22/23/24/24bis

Chair
: Proposing to shift whole section to IV

Deletion of brackets in P24.
Saudi
: Welcomes everyone to come visit Saudi but especially Chair. Consults Lawyer advisor and ominously says that he holds her responsible for accepting the deletion of brackets. Yikes.

Moving on. Things speeding up now.


Chair
: Consult amongst yourselves and come back at a later date.

Left room.

ADP Contact Group - 3/12/2015 - 3pm

Chair
: Time discussion is over, time for action is now

Sudan
: On behalf of Africa Group. Strangest session he’s ever been to, no noise. Reiterates that differentiation is the key aspect for Africa. The narrative from some parties is the world has changed since the convention but they don’t agree with this. Worried that there were be some backsliding from developing Annex 1 nations. Developing nations are increasing their obligations under the convention, but they recognise it is difficult to increase ambition. The proposed bridging can be done through:
Obligation that developed countries take clear lead for mitigation.
Developing countries are providing south-south support. They are of the view that the agreement should encourage this type of support and contribution. Not persuaded by agreement that the original convention is not in line with the current nature of the Parties of the agreement. All articles should have differentiation in recognising flexibility and natural circumstances.

Chair
: Doesn’t see how this comment helps feed into the process and welcomes Parties to propose text. How to translate this into text is what we need to pursue.

Colombia:
Several cross cutting issues across whole text. Asking for way forward from Chair.

Chair
: We are just responding to what parties asked for yesterday and are looking for a way forward. We thought this discussion would be a way to move forward.

Tuvalu
: LDC support African Group statements strongly supporting differentiation. There text that was proposed for the text that increased more than developed countries; “Developed countries
and those willing to do so
”. This is how they would like to address differentiation.

Chair
: We have always recognised the special circumstances of LDCs and SIDS.

India
: Africa provided a good starting point on differentiation. They see it as important to use the convention as the starting point for differentiation and that the original Annexes should continue. They say it is clear that developing countries are being ambitious if you look at INDC’s. They are cautious of terms like “
and those willing to do so”
because it may not recognise historical responsibility
.

Chair
: Rambles something about Mahatma Gandhi.

EU:
Agrees you can develop without growing emissions. World is highly differentiated and new agreement has to reflect this. There is not a one size fits all approach. Self differentiation already agreed for mitigation. We need to continue to have economy wide targets and those than can need to take lead. Looking into the area of finance they are committed to do so. For transparency they see the need for flexibility of methodology and timelines, and that developing countries need support to develop this.

Uganda
: They want to reiterate that the agreement has to be inline with the Convention of differentiation.

Chair
: Applauds all countries that have submitted INDCs so far ignoring the fact they don’t set us on a path to less than 2
°
.

Norway
: This is obviously a cross cutting issue. Think there’s are some new ways to get a text but wants to find some sort of way of capturing these sentiments. Agrees with Tuvalu that cutting the world in two was never the intention of the Convention. Shouldn’t include text
those willing
as everyone should be willing and some of the most ambitious targets have been by developing countries. Need to acknowledge that “everyone” is willing to increase ambition on INDCs.

Chair
: Talks about how this agreement should be durable.

Colombia
: Agrees on differences between differentiation from start of UNFCCC till now. In mitigation they don’t see the need to add differentiation as there is self defined differentiation. Need system to build levels of capacity when they don’t exist. In Global Stocktake they don’t see need to mention CBDR. They consider that countries has special circumstances and having an opt-out on some of the chapters.

NZ
: Jo takes the floor. See differentiation issue as critical. Agrees with Norway, Columbia and EU on mitigation and supports self differentiation built on strong rule and flexibility. A durable agreement requires strong division between legal implications between developed and developing countries is not helpful??

For mitigation there is no need to specify differentiation and supports provisions of no backsliding and building in text for increasing ambition. Those that are in need of support for adaptation should be given support to do so from those willing and able. On transparency all countries need to a part of the process with the principles of no backsliding.
Built-in
flexibility and capacity building is need to support increasing ambition. We need to create a framework where all parties can increase ambition over time.

Tuvalu
: Responding to the EU we think there is a concern of self differentiation. See the need to define certain countries in mitigation. They don’t support a one size fits all approach and sees the need for clearer defined differentiation on mitigation, including finance.

Ukraine
: The world is changing. Need flexible differentiation. Ukraine still Annex 1 country even though GDP is less than many ‘developing countries’.
Dynamic differentiation
they say is important. In this respect they support NZ, Colombia and EU proposal of self differentiation. Practically CBDR can exist within self differentiation between rich and poor countries.

Mexico:
On differentiation the see there is room for operationalising this in finance, mitigation etc. (Didn’t catch much of this.)

Gabon
: Gabon is committed to reducing emissions and preserving their forests. The challenge is to formalise how each countries will contribute.

Venezuela
: To put it bluntly. They are annoyed about the concept that the world is not the same. They say it is the same and hasn’t changed and the way countries define their historical responsibility. They reject that some countries don’t even want to make certain financial commitments. On climate finance the world is still the same. When it comes to effective mitigation countries are still not taking the action required if we look at INDC’s. Differentiation and equity are key. This is about a binding agreement not collaboration. This is not about countries that are not able to do so, but it needs to be differentiated to be meaningful.

Turkey
: Differentiation it is at heart of discussions here. Turkey suffers the most from historical differentiation so supports dynamical differentiation echoing NZ, Colombia, EU. Say that Turkey is a developing country and still wants to receive international support and wants to receive climate finance to adapt. Their INDC is unconditional and want more international financial support to do more on mitigation. We would like to receive more support financial support. They support and agree with what Ukraine said.

Nigeria:
Wants the world to take action on climate change. Encourages more courage to reach an agreement and says if we are not careful we may repeat 2009. Should differentiation still be in the agreement? Doesn’t think so. There is already self differentiation so what else is needed for agreement to hold. The way the process is going now is far away from being transparent.

Malaysia
: On behalf of LMDCs. We know each other's views already but we accept that you will not be persuaded. World has changed but historical differentiation has not changed. You created the problem but now say we should share responsibility on an equal basis. You acknowledge historical responsibility and differentiation but still won’t take action on this basis. Points out that the finance commitment has not been realised. All that is required now is for us to reduce our emissions and cut back on our industrialization conditional on support with means of implementation. Points out that civil society has done a reviews that are useful including ActionAid, ChristianAid, Friends of the Earth showing that developing countries are doing their fair share whereas developed countries are not meeting their obligations. In every thematic area there is no sincerity around differentiation and means of implementation. The challenge EU statements on self differentiation as it doesn’t meet equity. They are making very strong redlines on this differentiation and countries not taking their responsibility and this hard truth. You only deal with it through bracket. They want obligations that are much stronger and binding. Strongly and passionately advocating for differentiation. Intervention ends with applause.

US
: Supports agreement with differentiation. Need this to create an agreement which is strong and durable. Supports CBDRILONCWRC
.
No one size fits all approach. Need to work together to enable every party to do what they are capable of but doesn’t force those not able to do too much. Developing countries will be eligible for support to carry out mitigation. Support flexibility of contributions from LMDCs. Transparency, need flexibility for countries to take responsibility and learn by doing. Flexibility on reporting etc. Need to create a safe space for countries to develop in this space. On finance they say they will contribute to developing countries as their president has made statements about.


Saudi Arabia:
Malaysia captured many ideas he wanted to raise. Differentiation and equity can not be separated. Back home people saying ‘why do we have to do this?’. In talking about capacity they talk about the pain that countries have to go through to either adapt or mitigate.
Delivered INDC in good faith and plan to follow through with this. Really want to decouple growth from emissions but asking for support to do this. Decoupling is expensive, need technology transfer. Where is the support on the table right now? Saudi is ready to engage but calling on developed countries to fill in gap between INDCs now and what the science says, not their responsibility. They say they don’t have the space to increase ambition and that it’s developed countries that must fill the gap.

China
: They support the statements from Malaysia. As a non Annex 1 group. Don’t expect to get more they talk about the feeling of this group directed at developed countries. As many NGO’s show China’s INDC’s is fair and ambitious. They don’t want to see new ideas and concepts that are outside of the convention. China believes that to anchor CBDR in the agreement it needs to ensures that the purpose is to enhance the implementation of the convention. Article 4.7 is important to reflect CBDR. They agree that different elements of the text should be seen within different differentiation. Adaptation support should come from developed to developing countries. Cannot not accept new phrase with parties ‘willing to do so’.
Strongly advocating for a continuation of differentiation. For legally binding they do not want to see exclusions for different parts of the text.

Algeria
: Support Sudan and Malaysia (LMDC & Africa) Differentiation the know the are guided by the fundamental direction of the convention considering the historical responsibility of Annex Key questions: How will historical responsibility be integrated into the agreement? & How will this converse non-annex 1 countries.  On progression of non-annex 1 countries show strong willingness to show ambition to mitigate. Another q: How can we commit to a progression concept when it is the first time for our countries to engage in a mitigation process? We need an opportunity to see how we will carry out mitigation. Cannot forecast future development trends 2025 onwards. Progression needs to be affirmed for developed countries. While developing countries need an assessment first at 2025 and review how they can progress from there. Legal form: We are of the view that we need a legally binding agreement, but in naming an agreement legally binding we may end in some legal issues for some countries but not all. Transparency: We have a very transparent system with ICA. In complying with differentiation we don’t think there should be a unique transparency system for different countries.

Sudan
: On behalf of Africa. Talking around how differentiation should be defined in the text. They don’t believe a world with no clarification will not keep the world safe. In light of self differentiation and in light of national circumstances differentiation, contributions should be self determined but this does not equate to self differentiation. Doesn’t see this discussion as useless but

EU
: Complains about how long he had to wait to speak. #TwoHours. They wonder how this meeting is adding value with the general interventions. Not sure what we are doing here. Unless we start engaging in the text we are not adding value. Calls on chair to add structure to the conversation. Definitely not advocating for no differentiation. Advocating for more differentiation not less. At the moment we have 180 forms of differentiation. On transparency we are advocating for flexibility but is wide ranging. Worried if some parties think that others are advocating for one size fits all as hasn’t heard anyone say this. Rejects that all countries have failed under KP first commitment period.

Indonesia
: Has same view as Sudan. Allow room for countries that are ready to move forward. Taking into account countries with special circumstances. This could continue to progress as countries circumstances change. Developed countries should take more responsibility.
Legal form: should be a legally binding instrument under CBDR principles. Should provide support to developing countries. Implementation not always about finance but about capacity and technology transfer.

Australia
: As reflections on the meeting they see that all parties have spoken in a view of differentiation and that they feel no one size fit all. Make the point that differentiation is already in text, so the question is how do we communicate this up the chain. What value can we get out of that? All parties have spoken about making the greatest ambition so far. INDCs are great example of this. We note that all parties need support. In the context of our commitments they say they have met their targets under KP1 and will meet their commitments under KP2. They say that we’re on track to meeting the $100b goal.

To chair: How best to use what has been discussed here and how to move forward?

Ethiopia
:
Last night we spoke of how we need to speed up negotiations *Speaking slowly* but today we haven’t seen this. Self differentiation is a dream to me. If there is self differentiation why would there be an agreement at all?

Doesn’t hear much difference in what has been said in this room but once time is up it will all be forgotten. This should be a component of the legally binding agreement we are working for. Is frightened that because we are not recording in text it may simply vapourize.

South Africa
: They talk about how differentiation is obviously the cross cutting issue. On finance: the agree with G77. Mitigation: They find it important which is why they have committed to reducing emissions. If differentiation is clearly made in the article 3 then we need to pull it right across the agreement. They see the regime should be flexible for MRV and transparent. Last element, adaptation: each country has a responsibility to it’s citizens to adapt and poorer people suffer the most which is why equity is important.

Brasil
: Echo last point by South Africa. Don’t need to repeat CBDR in every paragraph but calls on parties to not bracket it where it clearly belongs. If developed countries don’t take lead there is no motivation for developing countries to increase ambition. We must all move together to increase ambition, but first developed countries take lead. But this is currently refused in SOGs.

Japan
: Clearly mitigation efforts by annex 1 countries will not be enough. System of self differentiation in form of INDC worked. The annexes no longer match the realities of the present. On mitigation as it’s proved through the INDC’s it’s showing there is differentiation between contributions. INDCs should not be entirely conditional to support but partly is OK. Vulnerable countries should have support. On transparency: reporting on contributions is very important, which it should be applicable to all. The new system on transparency should include a tiered system. New system requires us to have flexibility, countries should choose their tiers. On finance --
J
apan continues to support adaptation to vulnerable countries and wants an expansion of donor base needed.

Chair
: List closed but time for two more countries.

Pakistan
: Everything has been said -- with everyone saying good things, but the draft agreement has many brackets. The responsibility goes to the co-chair to come up with proposals that cross these issues.

Kiribati:
Interested that there seems to be agreement.
They are alarmed though that the conversation could go on for 20 years and they do not have this type of time. Recognition of special vulnerability but recognition is not sufficient we need action. We need help now. The type of differentiation is one of urgency.

We are the front line. When we fall others will follow.


Chair
: Thank you Kiribati. When you fall we will all fall.

Highlights the fact that he is new to this process (again).

Meeting adjourned. Resume at 7pm.

Digest:
Not much achieved here. Everyone acknowledged the need for differentiation but differed in the way differentiation language should be used in the text, still no way forward on how to operationalise differentiation. No parties changed their positions from what was expected. Many developed countries questioned the value of the 3hr meeting as most time was used just repeating same message.
ADP Contact Group
- 3/12/2015 - 7pm

Chair
: Try to get through as quickly as possible (Yay)

Contact Group Facilitator
: Have not managed to get out of Decision text yet.

Adaptation facilitator:
Several hours work with streamlining 4 paragraphes of 12. Acknowledges work of bridging text.

Preamble Facilitator,
article 2/2bis: Went through progress. Responded to bridging proposals. Worked on Article 1/2/2bis there is opportunity to advance in these areas. Generally positive.

Workstream 2 Facilitator
: 3 hours in the spinoff group with lots of engagement from parties but nothing was really achieved. Mitigation could be moved. Issues around implementation and means of implementation.

Tech Dev Facilitator
:Parties met informally resulting in SOG. Diverging views on if should be discussed in finance or mitigation? LTG in Tech framework, parties worked hard but could not decide on clean text. Propose working group on this.

Article 11/12-26:
Group has been engaged all day to try figure out remaining issue. 8 clean
articles
in final clauses. Entry into force remains a technical discussion, need more time. Issues on cross cutting matters. On compliance asked for bridging text. Time did not help in completing whole mandate.

Mitigation
: Met in SOG. Looking at bridging text proposals. Made some adjustments to compilation text and brought to contact group. New text will better enable the group to move
forward
than what is currently in the compilation. Propose replacing
acronyms
with smiley face for now so that when we look at them we can all smile (Actual proposal….)

Finance
: Further work is needed to produce leaner text in
article
6. Parties started to engage on transparency with bridging text produced. Still have an issue with placement of text. Some appetite for engagement but moving VERY very slow. Need to get moving faster

Transparency
: All paragraphs have been covered with 6 paragraphs deleted due to duplication. Not able to negotiate decision text due to time
constraints
but able to look through and comment on this. With regard to decision text some parties are quite far apart. Spirit and willingness to do this work is there but pace is EXTREMELY slow. Agreement text was slowed down by issues with cross cutting text.

Global Stocktake
: Bilaterals held this morning on a proposed on a streamlined text. That text after being reviewed was presented the spinoff group this afternoon. While it started well -- parties wanted to include new text and some parties questioned some issues that hadn’t been discussed. #ADPLogJam

Chair
: Intention to have document for Open ended contact group by tomorrow morning. Tonight focus on areas of text where there is most promise for resolution.

South Africa:
Progress is irregular. Adaptation did not progress as expected.

Bolivia
: On behalf of G77+China. Expressing concern with bad faith negotiating. Working very hard to prepare bridging paragraphs on almost every group. Message they are getting for adaptation and finance from Developed countries is NO TEXT. Not sure how we are supposed to move forward when there is little desire to address concerns of poorest and most vulnerable in this process :(. #CryingforLDC

Chair
: Everyone working long hours and nerves/tempers are frayed. Hopes that we still have faith in the process and will continue to the deadline which is noon Saturday. Sometimes work can be valuable in SOGs as we have experts but now is probably  time to bring things back to the contact group.

Venezuela:
Criticizing facilitator. Allowing brackets to be added. Requesting facilitators to respect every delegate from each delegation. Countries should not have to call head delegate for each decision.

Tuvalu
: There hasn’t been a good discussion about loss and damage due to the fact that adaptation has been dominating conversation. This is worrying for them.

Malaysia (LMDC)
: All the issues for developing nations have a no text option. This is bad faith by developed nations. We support G77+China that we need to reflect on this.

EU
: Concern about reports of non-flexibility. They’ve been making bridging proposals across the week. Thinks there is political will to make agreement on all issues. Up to 2020 and beyond they are committed to $100b. They want a ratchet mechanism that can increase ambition post 2020. They want a long term goal. On the question of differentiation we accept it and we are acting on it. EU accepts that there will be differentiation in different forms in different parts of the text. The trouble they are having is coming to a single conclusion on a specific piece of text around differentiation. Negotiations are very multifaceted and no-one can grasp all aspects at the same time this is causing the pace to be so slow. There needs to be a package of text rather than single text propositions. Need to move beyond a blame game. We have shown flexibility and believe other parties have too but need a step change in process. #Micdrop

Norway
: Need a step change and more rapid approach. Not pointing fingers. Need new process to move forward faster. Negotiators finding it very hard to get bridging text accepted. Blame game not helping anyone.
*Norway stopped to send a text message* = “Have you had dinner?” / response = “Yes, but only a sandwich” / “Let’s go get Malaysian”.

Haven’t had enough time to sort out all issues.

Turkey
: We
are
with everyone
who
has a desire for successful result. Current draft needs to be streamlined. We want an ambitious agreement.

Chair
: 3 points. Every single document we have produced (ex Geneva) will continue to be a non-paper. As of tomorrow morn 10 we have only 24

HOURS!!! to finish work. Need to send cleanest text with fewest options. Anything that goes forward must be acceptable to all. Simple as that. It may not be far enough/too far for some but we must find middle ground

*G77+China need time to huddle to meeting adjourned - 20min (at 8.15)

Meeting starts again - 9.07pm

Chair
: Time to hear what you were talking about.

G77
: The proposal:
Co-facilitator compile updated and streamlined text
Co-facilitators provide clear bridging proposals in a separate document.
Spinoff be used when necessary but the text comes back to the contact group
and text agreed by CG before sent to COP

Chair
: Agree with proposal. Then promptly wrapped up the meeting in order to resume tomorrow morning. Meeting adjourned. #You’rekiddingme

That’s all folks. Over and out.
ADP Contact Group
- 4/12/2015 - 10am

New text out as of 10am
Work of contact group(48pgs):
https://unfccc.int/files/bodies/awg/application/pdf/_adp_compilation_4dec15@1000.pdf

Incorporating Bridging text (38pgs):
https://unfccc.int/files/bodies/application/pdf/_adp_bridging_proposal_04dec@1000.pdf


Good morning folks
Co-Chair
: We are waiting for Secretariate to put text on the screen then we will get going.

Argentina
: To clarify we have two texts? One from working groups and one prepared by secretariat?

Co-Chair:
Yes, one is work of contact group (48pgs) and the other incorporates bridging text from the co-facilitators (38pgs).
Apparently no-one has slept all night. Yikes.
Just giving everyone some time to prepare themselves atm.

Co-Chair:
Agree that SOGs will finish work by 6pm so that we can have a look at it. But now we have two texts (See above). Request has been made for hard copy but only going to print 196 copies as co-chair is concerned about paper use. Text should not be a surprise to parties as they have been working on them.

We intend to be here this morning, afternoon, evening and beyond and luckily we have some apples to get us through.
    

    Impassioned plea that the time is now for everyone to be flexible and work together produce a text.

South Africa:
On behalf of G77

We actually requested the second text only contain the bridging proposals but it seems to be a combination. We have apples and oranges in the second text we were hoping for only apples. So we will see how to work with this.

Venezuela
: We request printing whenever there is a change in text. Not everyone should have to do negotiating on a
smartphone
.

Malaysia
: Thanks for preparing the text. Problem for us is quickly identifying bridging proposals to speed things up.

Co-chair
: Ok seems fair

EU:
Text is an improvement but still not ready. We actually prefer bridging in text but can they be highlighted so we can see in context. Super conscious of time constraints. Significant step forward but still not remotely enough. Request for guidance moving forward.

Nigeria
: Repeats call for hard copies. Complains a little about two texts.

Co-chair:
Repeats for
4th
5th
time that everyone has worked all night. Basically saying stop complaining, this is text we have all been working on. Calling to resume at noon SHARP, this gives parties time to read through text, prepare positions and hardcopies will be printed with bridging proposals highlighted.

Malaysia
: Wants more time to prepare and instead of coming back at 12 with “Half baked” proposals, coming back after lunch so they can really engage.

Co-chair:
No this is last day. We will need to discuss the way forward so we don’t waste time at 3pm. This meeting is adjourned and will resume AT NOON SHARP.

*Co-chair looks exhausted and rubs his face with his hands* #Toughjob

We are back

Co-chair:
Hard copy being distributed.

South Africa
: We are looking for guidance to meet back at 3:00 to look at the text properly

Co-Chair
:  Asks the parties if that’s alright.

No one disagrees and the CG will meet back at 3:00.

Is that a COP branded apple? A COPple?


ADP Contact Group
- 4/12/2015 - 3:15pm

Chair
: Welcomes everyone into the room and reiterates that COP Pres needs the text at noon Saturday. Chair acknowledges that people are human not machines and mistakes have been made but these will be cleaned up. Mode of work, confirmed officially that SOGs have stopped all work now to be carried out in Contact group. We are not suggesting a line by line discussion this would make finishing impossible by Sat. Suggestion is to take article and agree that it is the starting point and move forward from there. Laying down ground rules, please be civil guys. Just share what you believe. Secretariate will aim to form text by 9am tomorrow to capture gist of conversation. Chair acknowledges that Turkey wants translation but refuses to give them the floor and is committed to translating it for the Ministers

South Africa
: Ready to negotiate on bridging text. Wants a process for when there text have not been adequately acknowledged.

Chair:
Now time is not to listen to positions, we already know these. Now is time to share changes, proposals and new information.
Angola
: As LDC’s we want to support G77’s position and wants to draw attention to the loss and damage section as they feel the bridging proposal does not take their views into account.

Sudan
: They are thank for the compilation text. They are open to bridging text but will work on the basis of the compilation text but may default back to the original text when there are ideas they feel are not representative of their view.

Australia
: Going to be brief. On behalf of Umbrella. Supports G77 position.

Chair
: Is encouraged by Australia’s support for the G77 position.

*Chair has a definite tone of urgency*

Maldives (AOSIS):
Align with G77+China. But some essential pieces left out from compilation text.  Need to speed up.

Chair
: No objection to proposal by G77 in work stream.

Korea
: Agree with Co-chair that we should avoid repeating position.

Venezuela
: Feels just so hectic and stressed. We are going to reach an agreement and have all the tools to do this. The concern of her group is that the chair made statements about not new text and only bridging text should be introduced. She is a professional diplomat so calling on Co-chair to trust her. #burn

Chair
: Asks for trust in the chair. Yes it is 3.40 and we haven’t started so yes I am stressed ok! I am also anxious,
Malaysia give me the good news! *Laughter*

Malaysia
: Supports Australia who supports the G77. Sometimes get lost in the Chairs “forest of words”.

Chair
: I don’t want you to get lost in the forest of Borneo.

Sudan
: Our group doesn’t want to introduce new ideas just clarifying they want their views heard.

Chair
: Now let’s move to Article 2. Really really really thankful to secretariate and facilitators.
This is the part that has been changed. Is happy to take this to the plenary. Now moving to 2bis -- says this is fine to move forward to plenary. Now moving to Article 3 (mitigation). Is asking for points for order. The following are points of order from Saudi Arabia, Australia etc.

Now article 3.
c

Saudi Arabia
: Too fast for us we are not finished with article 2. Wants to know status of article 2 and whether this position is what flies.

Chair
: When you have analysed it come back to us. You know position of your group. No more spin off groups.

Australia
: Taking agreement & decision at same time or separate?

Chair
: Taking agreement first then decision.

Venezuela
: Is concerned that the Chair is ruling on articles and says if this is the case on the articles then “this process can go all the way to hell”

Cuba
: Is eager to make progress but is concerned it’s moving fast. Proposes that moving forward Parties should make comments on individual articles.

*Things running super fast here, many groups trying to put the brakes on a little*

Chair
: Agree with you.

Kuwait
: Support Venezuela and Cuba. Asking why the preamble was passed by?

Chair
: Says that process is that the preamble is looked at after the articles.

Ecuador
: Confusing process, if this is first reading we need to comment and discuss if we don’t accept certain bridging proposals. At article 2 they want to raise flags about consideration about second part. Is comfortable to move forward but is
flagging
that there are bits that are missing.
Several elements not captured in pp10

India
: Shares concern of the pace of the process and wants to draw attention to article 2. 1 (c) because there is no bracket. Wants to but a bracket around it.


Chair
: This will be done.
Angola
: Wants to come in and add in on article 3.

Chair
: I hope that is very soon.

EU
: Do think the bridging text is sig improvement. Mostly editorial changes and clarifying options needed. Still long way from text for political decision making. They want to work with compliation text as the basis going forward. Wants to urge parties not to try to load text back up. Need to focus on
KKKEEEYYY
parts of text parties want inserted or inconsistencies. Moving the conversation forward EU supports Saudi having a voice on article 2 urging for a constructive view.

Bolivia
: Highlight that key missing element, “protection of integrity of Mother Earth” thinks brings views of millions and millions of people.

Maldives
: Concerned with chair and speed.But now speed has slowed right down. Is asking how the conversations that were made in the spinoff feed into this position, especially in regard to positions that AOSIS think are missing.

*Chair looks annoyed*

Chair
: Thinks everyone is in good faith but is concerned with speed.

US
: Trying to understand how to engage on article 2 and preamble. Are we forwarding on or coming back? Wants clarification. Important to clarify that some bridging text represents a different level of discussion than we were working on.

Chair
: Saying that we will come back to the article and the preambular later -- but we can do it now if need be.

Sudan
: Same understanding as EU. Reading through text and seeking to look at bridging proposals, reflect on them and decide whether should be part of text to COP. From their perspective they want to ask for an opportunity to insert text and say they have substantive comments on preamble, article 2, 3.

Chair
: WIth that can we proceed with article 2? No ok continue list

Sudan
: As Africa group we think article 2/2bis could be forwarded to COP.  But the article 2 and 2bis they believe in can be taken forward.

Turkey
: Thanks co chairs/secretariate. Full confidence BUT on article 2 in compilation would like to see language around protection of ecosystems included as was not bracketed in compilation.


India
: Want the just transition language. They want to limit the brackets and move forward by saving half of the text from being bracket before the economy text.

Japan
: In the first paragraph of article 2. They want to put in brackets the second sentence or delete if possible.


Tuvalu
: They want mentions of natural ecosystems(same as Turkey) and Indigenous people in the purpose.

Canada
: They think it important to keep indigenous people and humans rights in article 2. They cannot support language around ‘people under occupation’ not the right place for this. They can’t have legally binding in the form of “
shall
” in the purpose.

Pakistan:
Article 2.1(c), the terms which were asked to be bracketed have not been. They have a problem with the term of “transformation” due to a wider meaning, the support and gradual shift or a pathway to sustainable development. They are concerned discussions have not been brought back into the room from the spinoff groups.

*The list of speakers grows as Chair tries to close* - *4:17 now*

Egypt
: Struggling to understand process. Not clear how interventions are going to be reflected in the text. Two minor elements they want to flag in the preamble pp6 with reference to African Countries and they want to see it back. The want to add brackets around bits before people under occupation. Was in compilation document

Chair
: Purpose of this meeting is to delete brackets but we seem to be adding them

Venezuela
: Is calling for 1(c) in article 3 to bracketed sustainable development is not purpose of this agreement. Wants to debate entire purpose of agreement and is calling for more options to sustainable development. We have to change process or we won’t finish by 6.

Chair
: already 30 interventions on article 2. Not going to finish by 6. Please help us.

United States
: Wants brackets around the whole article 2. #NotHelpful They don’t want a purpose in the agreement, but say they have supported long term goals, and an aim for finance. They are making the point that they don’t want article 2. (Note. The no text option was removed in the compilation). They say the purpose is enhance support for parties and refined down to what is in the convention.

*Collective groan from observer room*

Jordan
: Support the right of people under occupation.

Saudi Arabia
: Supports the right of people under occupation/indigenous people in support of human rights section. Very important.

Chair
: Guys stop restating known positions.

Brazil
: All parties have had a chance to engage for a long time. This is not new text. Parties keep restating preferences. But how can we find consensus on article 2? We acknowledge it is not perfect language but have to move forward. Need to discuss placement around pp10 in preamble and article 2. Sees brackets as carbon molecules which are polluting our text. Might need to look at 2.1(c) but they can leave and discuss when we looking at article 3.

pp10:



Chair
: Acknowledges stress in his voice and reiterates that we need not unravel what has been done.

COP President speaker
: Appreciate that whole group is willing to start on bridging proposal and is calling for the group to support each other in coming to a quality text to go to ministers. Does not want parties to spoil the text.

US
: (Point of Order) Willing to drop brackets around purpose text and work on it.

Sudan
: (Point of Order) Wants clarity around rules of engagement. We will consider bridging text proposal. Tables whole new proposal to have a huddle on bridging proposal and report back. If this is not satisfactory then go with compilation text.

Chair
: Considering proposal, taking a minute with a team talk.

*Time is 4.45. After 1hr 45 very little progress has been made.*
It is clear that when people say 1

minute at COP they really mean 15 #COPtime

South Africa calls for reassembly and to know what is happening

Chair
: Calls for parties who want to discuss leave and they can come back at 6pm.

COP President
: Just to reassure whatever gets submitted to COP is not end of negotiation. Calls for parties to compile list of key requirements to help formulate the text. Reiterates that parties can leave to discuss and come back



Co-Chair of ADP
: 750th request to restart discussions with polite please!


Malaysia
: Point of order to deal with behaviour. Bridging proposal is not negotiated yet, reflects view of parties so far. No need to bracket and unbracket. It is possible that some parties have key elements that are not reflected. ie ask EU any key elements then they submit in writing. On that basis there should be a new doc, compiling bridging and key elements missing. This would represent a sum up of working progress to date to be submitted to COP for line by line, paragraph by paragraph discussion.

Chair
: Anyone reject proposal?

Switzerland
: Who/what defines key element?
Parties have lost confidence in each other.
Could end up with Bonn situation with ballooning text
from 11 pages to 55
.

Chair
: Anyone else has comments on Malaysia’s proposal?

Tuvalu
: Thinks we are getting closer. Basis for key issues is difference of interpretation between facilitators and parties. We would need to bring back compilation text on Loss and Damage, bridging ext does not suffice.

US
: Many facilitator proposals will work but many won’t. Happy to work with bridging text, but need to id areas where bridging isn’t right and only way is to retain bracketing.
Let’s retain text, bracket it and move on, that would be the practical thing to do.

Chair
: I see head nodding this is a good sign.

EU:
Text still long way from fit for purpose, but bridging text is step forward. Important point is we are not agreeing a text here just forming a basis for next week. Avoid a game of bracketing, effectively the whole thing is in brackets atm. Parties should raise key elements here not just send them through so we can weed out ridiculousness. Here’s an example to kick us off:
Article 3.10 5

yearly stocktake and everyone submits INDC at same time. Key element lost is date which we want as 2021.
Article 3.18 Text hasn’t been discussed, would like opportunity to submit text
General approach has been to delete no text. Delete no text option on article 3 (Option 5)
*Our three key options include two key options and one "rather minor editorial point"*


Venezuela
: I agree with EU on the methodology on the CG on the articles: Only represent key elements, ie sovereign rights and discipline, on individual articles
. Venezuela agrees with EU agrees with Malaysia. Against all expectations, hell does not freeze over.
.

Chair
: Asking if this is fine to move forward.

Cuba
: Supports the proposal of Venezuela and supports Brazil's position on not adding more brackets. Most important thing is that we are here in good faith. We all know that L&D is key element. Tuvalu's mention of Loss and Damage is indisputable making point that because this is so important it should be brought back at their request. Does not need brackets on Human rights in article 2. Don’t need to discuss in separate rooms, the discussion should be here.

Chair
: I think we have moved beyond Parties going out of the room.

Russia
: Can’t remember why they raised flag, but think that it was about Article 2. Don’t want to waste time so move on.

Columbia
: Everyone should exercise uttermost restraint. Forget the Xmas wishlist and just focus on key elements. Was going to talk on Article 3 but will come back when that comes up.

Argentina
: On the “no text” option in 3.8 features we request that bracket options 1,2,3,4. pp14 accounting, pp15 methods and pp20 accounting the no text option is implicitly implied by brackets.

Malaysia
: There are bits in the text that we are concerned about. Are proposing:
Article 3.7 (information): insert after “in accordance with” “article 12 of the convention, 1/CP20.” and then end.

Article 10 (global stocktake):
p1 after periodically “take stock of implementation of this agreement...

First stock after x date

p3 “taking into account parties, differientationate responsibilities under the convention”

Nicaragua
: Agree with Malaysia, confused with process, are we discussing process or text here. Reiterates sovereign rights of each country to define their key elements.  They want “Mother earth”. The rights of indigenous people must be taken into account. On P10: option 2 the language they had wasn’t included. They want reinsert historical responsibilities into the text.

El Salvador
: Support “Mother Earth” inclusion. p6 of preamble “and the central american Isthmus”

Mexico
: 3bis P2 and P3 they want more brackets. For Adaptation 7C call for early warning systems. Article 7 (2) want socially and environmentally sound technologies that got dropped.

US
: Article 10:Doesn’t reflect from 2030 INDCs should have common timeframe of 5yrs. That element should be included. On timeframes, there is no beginning date for communications in global stocktake.

Norway
: Do not accept any changes as think it reflects current state of negotiations. Doesn’t think we need to change text as points can be discussed at later time.

Chair
: De-stress, take some time.

Sudan
: The key issues for them in article 3:
Asking for the deal to be consistent.

3.5 on support: They think it should be reflected on individual efforts

3.9 on first communication: This could be placed in decision or agreement.

3.14 & 3.15 on accounting: Need clear reference on transparency with a clear option that.
3bis on REDD+: There are also adaptation elements to this so it should also be a part of it rather than just being in mitigation.
The first communication is on too many areas and could be pulled together to include all other parts such as adaptation.
3.10 subsequent communications: not clear how we will deal with countries with 2030 INDCs and if this will be further addressed.
3.11 will this include support, not apparent
3.14 international transport emissions: maintain no text option
Decision text on mitigation has not been talked about in spinoff groups.


Maldives
: Adaptation, need to be a bit more clear on who provides support and to whom.

Marshall Islands
: Timing section clarity has been lost. They want the first stocktake to be in 2023. They want reference to the 1.5 degrees in sum. P20 & 20bis bridging proposal made and will pass on text to co-chairs.

Turkey
: P1 article 3: concerns of elements, wish to bracket whole paragraph. P3: They don’t like option 1 but support option 2. P5 supports, can be dealt with in subsequent sections. but pref is option 2 provided footnote 6 is retained and becomes operational.
P6/7/8 overlapping issues on transparency
P13 single annex, wish annex B
P20 don’t think right place for this. If staying prefer to use ‘
should’
Article 10 replace long term goals with long term temperature goal

Bangladesh
: They proposed in SOG on ‘climate change induced displaced people’ in loss and damage paragraph.

Guatemala
: The common timeframe from 2030 needs to be worked out. The first timeframe communication is important as well from 2020 or 2021.

South Africa
: They don’t accept unconditional INDC’s. In option 5 under mitigation they are under want it retained as their observation is that it isn’t been given enough weight.

Bolivia
:

aspects:
Article 2: Missing elements, keep ref to indg

and

Article 3: Missing is some kind of new mechanism to support SD with two options; a market / non market approach -- there is a missing element that is no provision for a new mechanism.

Costa Rica
:  Finance 6.10 missing reference mandate to CMA. Missing clear road map with targets to achieve goal. P6.11 reference to need to scale up is missing. ref to language of vulnerability is missing. P6.18 paragraph missing stuff.

Venezuela
: Article 3.1 (c,d) mention zero GHG and decarbonisation and they don’t like this (new language so unacceptable). Article 3(16) & (17): There is no mention of possible economic issues of adaptation.
Support Bolivia in having ‘no text’ with respect to markets.

Kyrgyzstan
: They can agree with para 6 of the preamble if there is a mention of the vulnerability of mountainous areas. They would like to see article 1 in the elaboration of developing state.

Tuvalu
: Text on L&D from compilation text reinserted as option 1. With respect to compliance the rules of procedure could be agreed with the CMA’s

China
: My eyelids have been swollen as I am allergic to some of these ideas but committed to work with parties towards agreement. Preamble p2 ‘and provisions’. Article 3, p10 option 1 technical should say ‘Before’. It should be period not cyclical in stocktake. In decision a technical mistake in p20 on facilitative dialogue that closed brackets at the end with open bracket at the end. 120 (f) a bracket is needed. There are technical issues around follow up work and who does this.

Panama
: We want to make sure vulnerable countries are added in the text.

Australia
: Missing 2 decision p34/35, article 9.6 option 2a, 9.6 option 2c get rid of ‘and and’

Saudi Arabia
: Calls parties to speak on the most important issues. Is finding it very hard to follow it. They don’t like the mitigation section generally. They want to somehow link mitigation and adaptation and the co-benefits of this. They don’t like carbon neutrality and zero carbon. Need to define these new terms. We aren’t clear on the progress we want to make by end of day. Advocates that shipping and aviation to do something -- is relatively unclear about what this is.

Switzerland
: We should focus on major concerns. Don’t want to read all technical aspects out. What is a tool to bring us closer together. Didn’t hear anything of major concern that can’t be address when coming back to the text and think the text is a good starting point for next week.

India: Doesn’t know process. Wants to add sustainable lifestyles in preamble. Article 9.X(c) Wants to see MRV here.

Bolivia
: On behalf of G77+China. They can work with  the bridging proposals that have been proposed in article 6 in finance. They find missing elements:
Not just provision of financial resources 2020 -- they need scaling up of the resources and the predictability. This is all about raising ambition.

-----Chair cuts in. It is clear that no-one is listening to you Bolivia.

Nicaragua
: pp18 brackets issue. Cap should be indicated in temperature degrees

Sudan
: Article 2.1 change language
Preamble language: pp5/pp6 red line for Africa group should be a reference to Africa
Seem to be in process that has been changing every 5 mins. We trust you. We do not see another iteration of bridging text proposal but still see this session as important and want a memo of views not another iteration.

**All proposals from parties are captured in Annex 2 of new document:
http://unfccc.int/files/bodies/awg/application/pdf/draft_paris_agreement_5dec15.pdf

Chair
: Sudan
’
s suggestion accepted. I think the wisdom of Africa has always guided us. With that the meeting is closed.

**How we feel about ADP right now VV**


ADP Contact Group - 5/12/2015 - 11am
Definitely running on COP time this morning, meeting scheduled for 11am, now 11.25am and no word on start time.

11.30: New draft Paris agreement just released:
http://unfccc.int/files/bodies/awg/application/pdf/draft_paris_agreement_5dec15.pdf


Essentially entire text in brackets.

Chair
: Sorry for being late but wanted to get the Draft Paris Agreement out. Text is in two parts Annex 1 and Annex 2. Annex 1 is bridging text and hasn’t changed. Annex 2 incorporates comments captured in afternoon session yesterday. Chair making point that if there is anything missed in the notes from the previous day - Parties should submit it by 1:00. Saying how grateful he is to facilitators. Asking to close this CG session and move to closing plenary session for ADP in 5mins.
**No requests from the floor so it’s closed**



Chair
: Now declare ADP open. To finalise the Paris Agreement and decisions on Working Stream 1 and 2 and to take this to the COP for wider consideration. Thanking everyone in the room. Agenda item 3. Lots of stats on how many times the group has met. Sig progress has been made and reflected in bridging text. Work started 4yrs ago in Durban and now we pass the baton to COP to complete the last leg. The last revision of the text has been delivered to Parties. The documents are Annexed now and is asking for Parties to adopt them.

China
: Draw attention to minor issue, the title. Should use the term draft agreement instead of Paris Agreement. This is a continuous document. Would prefer the title be called the
Draft Implementation Agreement
as not to prejudice the talks.

Saudi Arabia
: When contact group closed this was on understanding that notes could be added to Annex 2. Want to clarify.

Chair
: They will be recorded on the statement.

India
: Their understanding is that all the definitions it would be inserted in the bridging proposals but they don’t see it there. They want the definitions to be added to the draft agreement.

Timor Leste
: Would like clarity on document, some parts not negotiated but some key elements there. Re article 5 L&D we didn’t finish discussing so looking for clarity on how this will be negotiated.

Kuwait
: On Article 2 -- they want the reflection to note that no insertions should be made.

Chair
: re reflection note: effort to capture comments at Open CG. Anything that wasn’t added yesterday we are free to add them to the reflection note to carry them through to next week. On article 5: yesterday request was that compilation article 5 be inserted instead of that in bridging text this was noted. Their intention is not to change the document but they will add any further comments to the note. On China: the chair proposes to change the name to Draft Paris outcome

India
: There was something that wasn’t captured in the reflection doc so they’ve requested it to be added. Missed what exactly it was.

Chair
: Propose we adopt what was just discussed.

***Round of applause.***

Going to forward this progress to COP

President of COP
: *Missed start as en francais*
Not only one who feels real emotion around this. This agreement is result of 4yrs of hard work. This is a positive outcome -- but we need to write the next page together. Thanks Co-facilitators of ADP. Everyone has accepted to step aside national interests in the interest of the collective efforts. Thanks to the commitments of all the parties. Ownership is collective -- and this is a great achievement. Don’t have a plan B and don’t need a plan B. We now have a basis.This text demonstrates the will of all -- and agreement that is for all -- but more needs to be obviously to be done. To achieve a final result we will have to continue to keep working. Nothing is decided but we have a text that allows us to move forward -- nothing is decided until everything has been decided. The next days will not be leap into the unknown, it will be transparent and no country will be left out of the discussion. Listening to China’s statement she couldn’t help think that there is some sort of other name they were suggesting. Real sense of optimism now at COP21. This will carry us forward to achieve what we want to achieve.

*Very positive message overall*

Chair
: Thanks for the statements. Historical significance of this site le bourget. Quotes some trip he made 45 years ago. *Not sure how this relates* #PersonalObservations. Opening floor for statements.

South Africa
(G77 +China): Thanks the facilitators for the compilation text. Welcomes progress of the ADP. The group hoped that their work had been further along. At this point the group of 77 + china wishes to reiterate commitment to negotiate on pre-2020 and post 2020 agreement
They are willing to continue work on the new text and bridging proposals. We must remain focused on what we agreed in Durban. The want to reemphasis that the Paris outcome must be under the convention and must not try to rewrite the convention. Core elements mitigation, adaptation, L&D, finance, tech dev and transfer etc…..Adaptation and L&D must be given same weight as mitigation. They believe there is a strong text to forward -- but more work needs to be done. Much more work needs to be done to fulfill mandate of the COP. In the words of Nelson Mandela: It always seems impossible until it happens. It is in our hands. They call on the parties to deal with issues they have. They say they can not afford to talk more on process.

Switzerland
: (Environmental Integrity Group): This is sufficient progress -- they say the text clearly has all elements needed for a decision and reflects all the political decisions that need to be made. In comparison to Copenhagen this text has all the elements of an agreement we need. They are committed to an open ended process of achieving a durable,
legally binding agreement.

Australia
: Come a long way since Durban. Key elements are captured.  Progress not as fast as liked but we can take next step to create bridging proposals together.

They express the support for the presidency that is party driven and transparent. The process must achieve a LTD, INDC’s, a review process, transparent rules for implement, and all the adaptation and L&D text. We will not accept minimalist agreement. We can not get where we need to go by doing what we have always done. #Change. As developed countries they will continue to lead -- and all countries must continue to increase their ambition. In the post 2020 period they welcome the continued advancement towards our goal.

EU
: Text contains positions of all parties. Committed to work with bridging proposals. They look forward to 2nd week in the spirit of compromise. It is a cliche but the world is watching. #Tooright

Sudan
: Speaking on behalf of Africa group,supports the SA / G77 position -- endorsing statement in particular that the agreement that we hope to see in Paris. Thanking co-chairs for their work and the co-facilitators. The text is a true reflection of the Parties -- that will have a huge amount of influence on development to come. Moving to COP, we would like to reiterate confidence in Presidency and commitment to create agreement. Need process to be transparent, inclusive and reflects views of all parties.

Maldives (AOSIS)
: Supports G77 statements. Thanks Chair for hard work over the year. They hoped to further along -- but we are happy -- we just need to be mindful of process issues that have prevented us to move faster. The convention is the bedrock of this agreement. The convention talks about small island developing states and the agreement must continue with this unique position. In interest of time will end statement here but will issue full statement online.

Angola

(
LDCs
): Supports G77, AOSIS and Africa Group. We will submit full statement online.
There are some work to be done -- with bits of the text that needs more work that specifically are important to LDCs. Look forward to engaging in that process.

Turkey
: Thanking everyone and hoping to find common ground.

Panama (Rainforest Group)
: Supports G77 position
,
Thanking everyone. On Monday more than 60 head of State's talked about the role of Forests and combating deforestation. Ie. Redd+
Want a Redd+ to be in agreement. Respecting biodiversity was mentioned in more than 60 speeches from HoSs. This is important.

Malaysia (LMDC)
: Supports G77. Thanks everyone.  What seemed to be a lot of chaos thinks order has emerged. This is a workable text which has formed the basis and what we were trying to achieve. Great deal of goodwill and building on this. Good sign for week ahead. Talked about they must navigate away from aspects that are politically sensitive as we want to reach an agreement by building upon and enhancing UNFCCC..
There has be recognition of CBDR in all forms and must be preserved in all facets
. This forms the bedrock of convention. Would be futile to attempt to chip away at this. This principle is being sought to be diluted by certain changes. They want recall in 1992 the negotiations of the convention framework -- in the preamble i
t
recognises this -- but we need to make sure that developed countries take this responsibilities. Largest share of historical emissions are in developed countries. What is been proposed there is a destabilizing of the conventions strong CBDR. They want to include the “social science evidence” in reference to the agreement accepting the best available science on climate change. Being suggested that world has changed since 1992. Inequalities between countries have persisted. Many countries trapped in cycle of poverty.
Has the world really changed?
Making the point that the world isn’t as different as the original convention -- this is in the context of some Parties arguing that the agreement needs to recognise bigger changes to the world.
Urges to look at best available social science
. Are parties serious about CBDR? They want to navigate away from “parties willing to do so” -- but it has to be in the context of historical responsibility and equity. Then we can really move ahead. There are issues with the unconditional INDC’s -- these need to be conditional. We appeal to you, do not disassemble the principle of CBDR -- and look at the UN’s reports on the unequal word. Final points;
They are very supportive of the president's statements around transparency and party driven process
We must include civil society int
o
more areas where these negotiations are taking place #Tooright #ModernTechnology -- the time and emotional investment is needed. As developing countries we rely on Civil societies inclusion and expertise. This COP is a test of how open we are.
With regard to what I’ve said calls on Parties to address this challenge.

***Applause all around***

Saudi Arabia
: Not sure how to follow that. Fully support G77. We are ready to engage as the Arab group. This new agreement must deal with climate change and nothing else.

Venezuela (ALBA)
: Supports G77 & LMDC statements. Thanking everyone -- especially the secretariat. Calls for round of applause for secretariate. *Applause follows* #Sonice. Thank partners which adopt bridging proposals so we can move forward. This commitment to a party driven process with transparency we call for it to be committed to all the way to the end. They are calling for observers to be a part of the process to the end.
Quoting
a phase from
a
youth sign outside “nothing about us, without us”. This agreement is for them.

Guatemala (AILAC):
Supports G77+China. Never before have we been so close to address this challenge -- into a single agreement that includes all needed elements. This our chance to secure an agreement that is for the future. Our collective interests is what we are negotiating here -- self interest must not deter us from doing what is right. Here in paris we have unique opportunity to secure the future for generations to come. We must deliver on the collective effort. Net zero emissions as the LTG with finance. Every 5 years we must review our action. In particular a collective target of finance is needed from developed nations. An equitable and fair agreement must include L&D -- including institutional arrangements -- with post 2020 ambition should be fortified because of the ambition gap especially on mitigation. Unity and persistence is what we must hold firmly. Trust is needed. CBDR must be at the center of this agreement. AILAC is ready to move forward with bridge building proposals. The Output of ADP contains cornerstone of successful agreement

Extraordinary times require extraordinary effort and success is a must..

Marshall Islands
: Supports G77 position. Speaking as a
vulnerable
country we want an ambitious science based agreement -- we agree with the principles and provisions of this agreement. We are all in this together. We are here to convey from a growing global movement that is demanding a safe climate future. It is easy to see this negotiation competing for short term interests. A favourite term is nationally determined -- we are here to fight for global action.

Are not here to point fingers lay blame and divide, we are here together.

Parties reaching out beyond traditional groupings is encouraging to see.

Chair
: Moving to agenda point 3.

Rapporteur
: I ask that the ADP text be handed over.

Chair
:
Propose rapporter to work with secretariate to transfer text to COP. No objections? Great.

Other Chair
: Words on why this agreement is important. When ou
r


historians come to write of the meeting on the 5th of Dec. Parties came together to work towards an agreement. So that we can ensure that life will continue exist on this planet for our children and grandchildren. In the city which first adopted the Human rights 1789, we look forward to 11th of Dec when we can create a new piece of history. Is there anything left to be said which hasn’t been said in the last 4yrs? Sometimes words struggle to convey what is happening at such important times and we can only use simple words, so “Thank

you” for this journey and putting us in a position to sow the seed for an agreement which can
be
made this week. Thanks algeria for letting him be co-chair. Talks about role of Co-chairs. Congratulations in advance for what is going to be achieved on the 11th.

*Round of Applause*

Going to show us some pictures of the journey so far #FamilyAlbum. But first CFig.

Secretariate
: Says it wasn’t always easy -- but that’s not why we came here -- we can here because we are committed. This is not the end though, and we need you to continue next week.

Chair
: Hearing no objections it is so decided the meeting is closed.

And the slide show begins

Not ADP technically, but I do what I want.

Chair-

Notes progress on agenda item and welcomes Parties to express views.

Russia-
This issue start at COP18 in Doha. This is an urgent and important agenda item that requires close consideration and action here at Paris. This discussion on decision making includes numerous issues including the process of using. Russia has submitted a draft decision to the Lima conference FCCC/CP/2014/CRP1 , however this has not been adopted. Hope it can be smoothly adopted here in Paris.

Canada-
Thanks chair and constructive contribution from Russia. Need to maintain a forward looking and long-term perspective. Canada notes that there are numerous options on the table, including Russia’s draft decision. Not convinced that a draft decision is the optimal outcome.

Chair
: Anyone else?

*Awkward silence, tumbleweed goes by and no-one talks.*

Chairs
:
c

This is currently being streamed here:
http://unfccc6.meta-fusion.com/cop21/channels/plenary-2
But don’t worry we still plan to take some notes as well.

Chair (President of COP - French Minister)
: Kicking things off now. Just said when we solve all the issues we will be further towards an agreement #nokidding. Listing working groups that were set up on Saturday and who their facilitators are. Facilitators will present reports of their work streams and come up with an initial vision of the final text. Due to time constraints Pres calls on Parties to be flexible and helpful in their approach. A number of working groups have been formed beyond just ones started by the Chair that are led but country Ministers. Obviously they’ve been suggested by Parties. Calling Parties not to repeat positions but to find compromise so they can reach an agreement. Turning over to the first facilitator.

Gabon (Facilitator for Means of Implementation - relating to finance, technology, and capacity building):
Lots of work from today, with open meetings. Talking about the process as transparent. Since Sunday there has been an 2 open session, also had bilaterals with various parties. Some headway was made. A better under of climate finance has been developed on article 6b has developed, growing convergence. Discussion covered both consultation of covered general topics and specifics of article 6, plus the decision. Issues included , provision of support, mobilisation, climate finance scale and scaling up and provision support. Common ground is being found on provision support climate finance with flexibility with developed countries making commitments under the convention. Various parties had text proposal including how possible other parties could be captured in the decision. Vol contributions, and those willing and able to do so, and south-south collaboration. Parties also spoke of collaborative element of climate finance, however some Parties have been very reserved about their commitments to the convention.  Another issue scale and scaling up. In general there is agreement to address notion within agreement. In general there is agreement to address this problem -- but how this is implemented is still under discussion.

Chair
: Johan you have the floor *Cue dramatic entrance*

Germany

(Facilitator for Means of Implementation - relating to finance, technology, and capacity building):

There have been clear bridging proposals made in the indaba process. This afternoon there has been progress on a number of elements. Tech dev and transfer had a small group. Parties discussed both agreement and discu. Parties saw convergence on most topics.
Coverages was made on pre 2020 commitment. Agreed text has been developed on pre-2020 text. #Yahoo. Article 8.4 has some work going on -- and this will be presented back soon.
1hr meeting tomorrow 10am to discuss pre 2020 financing and how to move forward.

Full report on implementation:
http://unfccc.int/files/adaptation/application/pdf/means_of_implementation.pdf

Singapore (Differentiation)
: A plenary session on the L6 version of the text -- with many countries attending. Differentiation is important across the whole agreement and for all countries to be a part of the agreement. Key innovation which has boosted this area is the INDCs bottom up approach has allowed all parties to operationalise diff and allows ratchet up over time. Concepts of notion of travel and assurances of no backsliding resonated very strongly. Developed countries assured they would continue to take the lead. Taking into account countries own circumstances would help some parties accept this differentiation in the agreement. Article 2/2bis and 3. Some debate on applicability of 2bis but key point was that there has to be a balance emphasis on differentiation/support.

*Chair introduces man as Isabella. Laughter ensues, that is definitely not her*

Brazil (Differentiation)
: Regarding transparency: there was an assurance made that developed countries will take the lead without backsliding -- with differentiation will be operationalised with flexibility for developing countries -- and acknowledgement that countries are starting at different points. On finance: agreement that developed countries will continue to support developing countries. On donor base there is no intention to create new legal implications to develop[ing] countries. Voluntary manner of donations with no legal commitments on finance.

*Keeps mixing up developed/developing #soconfusing*

Full report on differentiation here:
http://unfccc.int/files/adaptation/application/pdf/differentiation.pdf

Norway
(Ambition)
: Plenary lasted 2 full hours yesterday. Took note of parties aspirations and concerns. Met with groups bilaterally. Available to facilitate all parties that want meetings. Several parties had prefered views to converge. Asked parties same 5 qs. #quiztime.
1st: Framing to reference of 1.5 degree limit
2nd: Acceptable long term goal for mitigation over different timeframes
3rd: Global moment every 5 years that frame mitigation, adaptation, finance and support with respect to national circumstances.
4th: Exploring 1st period including submitting or updating ambition and possible ratcheting up
5th: Exploring modalities

Saint Lucia (Ambition)
: Hearing ways to move forward but also hearing a lot of positions restated. S
o
me want 1.5deg and others still sticking to 2deg. Contextualisation for long term goal are still unclear. Long term goals of mitigation are being called for -- with many calls for climate neutrality and decarbonisation, and zero carbon by end of the century. Some called for zero emissions in 2nd half of century. Some parties wanted this as part of the temperature target. Some discussion about how this needs to be linked with quality science.Seems to be convergence towards 5  year period of the review and as a global moment.

Full report on ambition:
http://unfccc.int/files/adaptation/application/pdf/ambition.pdf

President
: Good work guys sounds useful. Keep it up. Now to the pre-2020 action facilitators.

UK
(Pre-2020)
: Progress made on workstream 2, but many issues remain. Many brackets were removed last week. Focus on accelerated on implementation has been our focus. Bilaterals were conducted today -- which will finish this night. Pre-2020 coverage. All recognise the need for implementation of all parties. There is common ground on a technique process on adaptation. Parties agreed that technical process on mitigation has been a success and could be a model for adaptation. On accelerated implementation: Facilitative dialogue would be comprehensive with all parties -- but with a focus on developing countries. These elements are not agreed and nothing is accepted. Some key elements still to be decided, will work on tomorrow and present final findings tomorrow.

Full report on pre-2020 action:
http://unfccc.int/files/adaptation/application/pdf/acceleration_of_pre-2020_action.pdf

President
: Could secretariate make the facilitators reports public on the website? If there are still issues get in touch with facilitators. If you want a debate (re process), the floor is open now.



*Stunned silence*

Tuvalu
: Welcome progress that been made -- but they have a comment. Meeting timing has been very short which has made it hard for them to track. Ie was surprised to have meeting on L&D today. Please let us know in advance!

Russia
: They express comments on the process of consultation to Ministers. They agree with Tuvalu. The information on consultations is something is not put on CCTV so the delegations are having a hard time following these events -- with meetings organised only 2 hours before they start. They would like to address this. In terms of location -- sometimes people have to sit on the floor and this does not make it easy to engage in meetings.



President
: We will give you sufficient warning. We will work on the seating arrangements.

Egypt
: 2 points, 1st paris committee should address differentiation. Personally feels lost. Who will do drafting, when will we see this?

President
: Proposed is facilitators continue to work. Whole idea is tomorrow evening we can have another report and then facilitators et al, will attempt to make a clean text for everyone to look at. Need to ensure process remains Party driven.

Malaysia

(behalf of
LMDCs)
):

We have heard the reports on the hard work done by the co-facilitators.  there is a lot of good will and a good exchange of views. Notes “cordial” atmosphere This is a good prediction of the conclusion of this.
They want to suggest after the bilaterals and the feedback that has been given on co-facilitators -- the next stage should be a reality check that the comments capture the balance of the comments. Being human the would like to suggest that the comments should be brought back to the groups for reflection. They want a process tomorrow of a group to reflect on actual text based discussion and a more inclusive process. Change mode -- some level of text based negotiations as we have built shared understanding through bilaterals.

Cuba
: Talks about strong will to get a good agreement -- and that spirit should continue. Agrees with issues raised by Tuvalu and Russia. Wants the process to move to higher level process and to wait till Wednesday will mean they are racing against the clock. Asking for possible text to be developed tomorrow -- in support of Malaysia proposition -- in a larger session to reach an agreement much faster. Aiming for Wednesday is risking -- and with the good will they should get ahead.

Venezuela
: Support tuvalu, malaysia and cuba. Process is tricky and everyone gets jittery. Grateful to France. I’ve never seen so many smiles. Everyone in this room wants a good result. Haven’t yet got white hairs over the process. Doesn’t want more bilaterals. Cites facilitation method and this worked really well for mitigation today. Shouldn’t have any more parallel sessions. Wants to make sure parties keep in control of the process. Agrees with Cuba and that the conference should move ahead with text based negotiations tomorrow.

President
: Oh gee thanks Venezuela, so nice of you.

Georgia
: They want clarity on the process -- and the implementation of any suggestions -- and will work closer with facilitators.

*Speaking incredibly fast*


President
: Will do



Guatemala
: Agree with Venezuela. Want clarity on process. Durban process worked and need to find some landing zones asap. Haven’t mentioned compliance yet but have trust that this will be completed on time.

Marshall Islands
: The are concerned about the proposition of Malaysia -- but are open to cooperate on new proposals to be inclusive of different views.


South Africa
: Remaining time is limited. Need another step change in approach. Next step is to get Ministers facilitators to use co-facilitators to develop text for proposal. The aim is that Ministers would be presented with this text for discussion for specific discussion about political issues. No later than Wed evening. As text becomes available, legal teams should begin to look through so that we can finish by Friday.

EU
: They want to be supportive of the process -- and having a line by line negotiations is impossible, but
a
minimalistic
agreement is not acceptable.
the French process is working. They support a new group on compliance.

President
: Understands that everyone supports facilitators. There is a wish that we could accelerate process by bringing in ADP facilitators to support new text. Is describing SA process. Is currently talking about different process options using ADP submitted text. Anything left on the agenda? Come to the end of meeting, we will have next meeting tomorrow afternoon. Catch y’all tomorrow (in very french accent).




Digest
:
After updates from the various working groups, parties came forward with a bunch of proposals for process which would move things forward. Secretariate said ok I will consider this and let you know tomorrow morning how we are going to proceed.







Comité de Paris - 8/12/2015 - 7pm

Chair
: Has listened to issues of the Parties at last night's Comite. Parties have meet in Indaba’s and bilaterals today and progress has been made on the key areas that are in the workstreams. Facilitators will report back, then based on the discussion from yesterday he will propose a working method.

Implementation Working Group
(Gabon and Germany): There have been a lot of consultation with open ended plenary, plus 4 indaba’s, and 6 break out groups. All parties were listened to. Thanks all parties. On A3 all aspects were covered -- with parties proposing text. Streaming has been done on A6. Concrete textual proposes have been made -- but work needs to be done and they can not be seen as agreed text. Parties have found coverance on A7 + decisions. A lot of progress has been made on a number of the articles. There are still some outstanding issues around capacity building and A8.5, plus differentiation in 8.5 & 8.4.

Means of Implementatio
n Working Group:
Differentiation is the still a key issue
and fault-lines remain
. Tonight there will be work with the secretariat. At this time parties are not ready to put their final decision on differentiation

Report:
http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/paris_nov_2015/application/pdf/report_on_minister-led_consultations_on_facilitating_implementation_and_compliance.pdf

Ambition Working Group
: A number of consultations have been made. This afternoon there has been a ministerial, with two meetings, long term goal and Xxx. Discussions have been cooperative. On the Long Term Temp goal -- most parties want the 1.5 in the text in the purpose. They want accompanying statements around food security and sustainable development. On global mitigation goal. 2 main strategies. 1st quantitative elements with short/medium/long. 2nd option is Long term qualitative goal. These need to be operational. There should be a global aggregate stocktake -- which must not impinge on national decision making. 5 year cycle agreed by most parties.  Issue remain with starting years and placement.
Most parties support synchronized timeline. 1 step or 2 step process? A number of other issues should be included in the Paris outcome to secure ambition.

India (Point of Order
): Some delegates are being told they can’t enter the plenary -- and wants the chair to intervene.

President
: Of course of course. Right on it.  Moving on to pre2020 facilitators

Pre-2020 Action Working Group
: Bilaterals have been going on. Parties continued to work informally to bring bridge the issues. On adaptation process -- process has been made -- with parties addressing each other's concerns. On accelerated implementation there is a divergence of positions -- with some parties not wanting any provision on this matter. Remains divergence of provisions. Some parties see very close relationship with workstream 2 (Pre-2020 action) and final agreement, but others don’t.

Report:

Adaptation L&D working group:
Over the course of the two days parties have been laying down their views. There are some additional requests for meetings -- these are being dealt with. Parties made it clear they support Article 4 -- supporting global goal on adaptation
Possible landing ground is a long term goal on adaptation linked into article 2. There are a lot of open issues. For article 5 (Loss and Damage), no landing zone as compensation and liability is a red line for some countries.

Report:
http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/paris_nov_2015/application/pdf/report_on_minister-led_consultations_on_adaptation,_loss_and_damage.pdf

Forests Working Group:
There is strong and clear understanding on essential items so there is hope there is some compromise which makes it clear there will be a landing zone. More work will be done this week.

Preamble Working Group
: Work will continue tonight -- with an Indaba held as the first meeting. They would like to do this, this evening.

President
: Will propose a text tomorrow which draws on all elements of the working groups from notes sent to the president by midnight. This text will not be the final stage. There will be the next text available at 1PM. There will be a 5PM meeting to hear first reactions to this text.
We will have to work in the evening and into the following day. #resigned Is welcoming comments.




South Africa (G77 + China)
:  This meeting is pretty useful. Thanked the open manner that the consultations have been carried out #Opentowho? Request that ample time be made for regional groups to consult in order to facilitate an agreement.



President
: Wise comments South Africa
,

Maldives (AOSIS)
: Supports G77 statements. The consultations have been productive with landing zones. Supports a new text being proposed -- that has specific needs of small islands developing states. We have full confidence that you will maintain transparency and inclusiveness in final days and andabah working well.

President
: Thanks.

Malaysia (LMDC)
: Supports G77. A couple of issues on process -- and he wants to thank the response measures and the speed of the President's action with more collaboration able. Going forward there is clear criteria, transparency, inclusiveness, party driven have been carried out so far. We suggest you carry on these principles however. “The test of the pudding lies in the eating”

Small matter on pre 2020 cluster group. Report on divergence of issue and no provision included. G77 has played ball and  put forward provisions. so pretty annoyed that these have not’ been used. This is super important as workstream 1 could be dependant on workstream 2. This will impact on developing countries flexibility on Global Stocktake and review. But we trust you President #Swoon



President
: Just to be clear report will be handed over at 1pm NOT noon. Apprently error in translation. #theyarehuman

Switzerland
(EIG): They want to indicate the proposal of the Chair in proposing text.

*Said entire intervention in one breath*

Angola
: Support G77, need to ensure 1.5deg and heartwarming to see this being pushed. Full support for cleaner text and time to examine it.

China
: Supports G77 (Obviously), supports other relevant countries statements re process. Hope to continue to carry out constructive work in the spirit of the conference.

Belarus
: Satisfied with proposal for process. Support transparency and openness in this process, want to see breakdown on screens/website for when different groups are working. This didn’t happen so well today.

President
: Yes, I’ve already sorted that out.

EU
: Supports process. All the time will be needed to reach an agreement. #NothingMuchToSay


Australia (Umbrella)
: Just put up flag to say you guys are the best. #Backscratch

    *Applause around the room, before everyone scatters to grab coffee before a long night*





Comité de Paris - 9/12/2015 - 3pm

We wait in anticipation of the much hyped text drop.


About to begin but no sign of the text yet.

Chair
: Meeting called to order. Sorry for delay. Just had a long night. Any moment now, secretariate circulating agreement. This will incorporate everything we talked about earlier. ie suggestions from facilitators.

The aim of the text is to enable us to have an overview of the progress made -- and the issues that need to be settled at the political level. This is not the final text. It might contain elements that Parties might not find accepted. 29 pages long text. 3 quarters of the brackets have been removed. There has been consensus on mitigation and adaptation capacity building. Almost concluded on adaptation. Lets us focus on L&D and views closer on this. Also closer on transparency framework. Progress on development and transfer of tech. Some progress on forests and preamble. Certain political issues remain and they are now clear. 3 issues are: Differentiation, finance and level of the ambition of the agreement. On these issues countries will scale up their work. We have tried to put out clearer options. We must all together make these crucial choices and agree on compromises. Progress has been made -- but work needs to be done. The best solution the Pre
s says is that the text will be circulated. Parties will then study it. You have asked for a long time to study the text. So ok I’ll give you to 8pm #niceguy. In that meeting I will give you proposals for moving forward. I hope everyone is ready to work overnight. Let us unite! but also find compromises.  See you all at 8pm tonight with your working caps on.

*Text being handed out around plenary halls.*

*Fabius super efficient in the meeting today. No mucking around*


Text has dropped here:
http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/da01.pdf

Time to get out the magnifying glass.


Here is a nice overview of the changes to the text:
http://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-the-draft-paris-text-has-changed?utm_content=buffer3d172&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer
Comité de Paris - 9/12/2015 - 8pm
In true COP fashion it’s 8.10 and no sign of anything starting yet.

President
: Hello and welcome all. I was generous enough to give you time to study the new doc so I hope you have all studied hard. Now I invite comments on this but please be brief. We will also look at process going forward. Key issues are still
Differentiation, fiance and ambition.  Is making a proposal about the ongoing work: An hour should be put aside to discuss and maybe even a grab bite to eat if you can. Then another meeting in an Indaba format. Focus on three key issues above. For conference to be success we need to solve these issues! Progress has been made but still not far enough. Many parties will say there aren’t many of us so I propose 3 key meetings without having 6 or so meetings which the smaller delegations couldn’t cover. The aim is to come back tomorrow with another version of the text after discussions from tonight. In the coming hours Pres asks not reopen issues -- but work on the political issues to be resolved. Under our rules we have to bear in mind delays for checking at legal and linguistic levels. Some articles are clean so the Pres is asking the translators to do the work needed to start translating the text.Now open the floor but please be brief.


South Africa (G77):
Concern about the agreement diverging away from the convention. Framing of many parties positions are not clearly differentiated. Numerous issues between the convention language and the text around differentiation; ie Adaptation. In means of implementation -- the group doesn’t see the assurances supported in the post 2020 period. Says there is no long term commitment on finance with scalable funds. Issues around finance tech transfer and capacity building. On capacity building concern with lack of differentiation. Agree there should be separate article on L&D There needs to be a permanent institution to deal with loss and damage.Concern with diverging from convention again.


Text is good basis but need to sort out cross cutting issues. On areas where parties have converged we need further informal informals to iron out remaining issues

***Clapping***

Switzerland
(EIG): Welcomes draft. The text is a good starting point. This a good starting points on a number of articles. They are concerned that the text is not balanced -- especially on financing. Some Parties have not made compromise -- whereas the EIG group has. A3.3 is contentious. Is calling for compromise. Are calling for more balance. #NotSureWhatBalanceIs
DPO contains complications. First comms on NDMC must be mandatory. 2bis cannot substitute specific contributions in articles 3/4/6/9. Article 6 needs more work to find balance -- and calls on parties to continue work. The transparency system must not include provision that bifurcated.
Finally emissions from aviation and marine transport should be included in agreement.



Maldives (AOSIS
): Support G77.

Would like to offer initial reflections on text.
Clear and operational manner. Strong preference of A2 1 (A)(3). Clarity on long term goal with quantitative approach for mid century and beyond. Mitigations -- prefer quantitative approach (opt1) . 2.3 to ensure no backsliding on INDC and NDC’s. More work is need on 3.2 and is happy to be engaged on this. On Adaptation there needs to be a link with Mitigation in accordance with CBDR. Loss and damage should remain separate (A5).  On finance the special circumstances of SIDS needs to be dealt with. The special needs of finance commitments of SIDS. There needs to be operationalising of MRV. Finally on workstream 2. Generally pleased only minor drafting issues. Very little time left and we’re ready to get down to work!


Barbados (CARICOM)
: Supports G77 and AOSIS. Thanks process. Is prepared to engage. 1st issue is with long term temp goal. 3 options in text. Some of options certainly not acceptable.
Will explore options of 2 and 3 in A2 (1). Preference for option 3 (1.5deg). It is not sympathy they are looking for. Climate change threatens our way of life. They will not sign off on an agreement that will end in an extinction of our people.Special circumstances are REAL. This reality is NOT NEGOTIABLE. SIDS have specific challenges with access to finance + technology. It would be a grave injustice for that that are on the frontlines of climate change to now be threatened with such neglect in this text. We can not leave Paris without Loss and Damage. The compliance mechanisms are weak -- but welcome the 5 year stocktake. Thanks for the bridging text but this doesn’t anchor REDD+ in the agreement. This needs to be anchored as an agreed mechanism. Wants to go back to his home and families with good news.

Turkey
: Parties are converging. We are at final stage. They have always stressed the text should balanced and based on realities. The text they think is close. They will continue consultations and want some notes to be removed from footnotes.

Australia (Umbrella Group)
: Significant work remains. They can’t see the balance of the text with little consensus. There is specific issues around differerientation. They want to be clear that the compromises text around developed nations taking lead needs to be flexible. UG wants a high quality agreement -- not just an agreement reached. They want the text to be a step change -- which requires a 5 year cycle and increasing ambition.

Ukraine
: Ready to engage and hope for an ambitious, durable agreement by Friday. Echo Turkey's position

China (BASIC)
: Supports the G77 statement. The 4 parties support the agreement and the Pres’s approach to the conference. They call for an accord of the conference. The deal needs to be fair and ambitious and forceful. The 4 parties are willing to be constructive to this accord. Current text is open and balanced and basis for which to address issues. Willing to engage with all parties to reach common ground.

Angola
: Supports G77 position & AOSIS statement + the statement that will come from Sudan. The LDC’s thanks the Pres. Consider this a good basis. Trust that process will continue with transparency and inclusiveness. The want to highlight a few issues to the LDC’s:
Concerns of balanced provision of least capable countries get access to finance. Other speaks have spoke on this.
Compliance -- is to address implementation
Goal -- they like that 1.5deg has been noted. The prefered option in A2 (1) (c)

Egypt (Africa)
: Proposed mode of work (andaba) is good. We want inclusive drafting process. Key political issues -- operaliatising differentiation, plus everything else that is difficult to deal with -- need to be dealt with tonight. Uncomfortable with a number of issues. Mitigation for developing countries being referenced without mention of support Implementation. On adaptation global goal is missing. In the absence on the clear options on the different options it is hard to engage on the political issues.

Guatemala (AILAC)
: Agree with G77. Deal must be legally binding and ambitious. Adaptation is a strategic area of action for developing countries. Loss and Damage needs more bridging proposals as it’s a key aspect of the agreement. A3,2 is key for AILAC. Other key aspects are features of mitigation commitments. Must be quantifiable. Must bear in mind vulnerable countries ie Peru. Important to retain mention of HR, gender issues and intergenerational issues #Yahoo

Chile
: There needs to be a clear LTG -- and that’s why they support A2 (1) (b). In A3 they want to support decarbonisation and climate neutrality, and they are calling for carbon trading.
global price on carbon They welcome short term cycles on NDC’s on 5 years with 2021 start as the latest. They want both preamble and operationalised human rights text.

Trinidad and Tobago:
They want the special circumstances of small island states and that it should be entrenched in the text. No island should be left behind. SIDS should not be burdened with same measures as more developed countries.



EU
: Some text moved to agreement. Key aspects now less binding and less durable. They need a bolder text on some key issues. Further iteration is needed. Many options cross our redlines. That means the Paris agreement would not be on track to achieve our objectives. The mitigation mechanism is not strong enough -- this will not keep us under 2 degrees. The bifurcated approach through the text. Aviation and shipping is not in text. After 2020 countries to do so should contribute to finance. In transport emissions have not been addressed. After 2020, countries in a position to do so should join finance. The approach for clear NDC’s has been lost. To summary we can;’t do line by line negotiation yet but will continue as you have propose.

Russian Federation
: 9 days ago HOS & govt confirmed the need to reach agreement and we really can’t leave without doing this (48hr left. Is wondering if 48 hours is enough time left. Need to spend the next 48hrs line by line to figure out compromised wording. We need to give hope to
the
world, they have been waiting for 8 years. We don’t have the right to disappoint them .



Saudi Arabia (Arab Group)
: Supports G77 statement.  Thanks Pres. Has a few reflections. They want to see a clear reference to A3. They want to see a clear statement of the adaptation co-benefits that are coming in the form of mitigation. As far as the goal -- it has to be durable -- doesn’t like specific number in a goal -- ie wants it to be a lofy goal that doesn’t undermine sustainable development (count that as the development of oil). Needs to be durable. We want qualitative goal #boo. Who judges who is in position to help and who is not (On finance). In regard to the adaptation -- they want a registry so people know they are doing something. They are concerned that only 60 Parties need to sign it -- they don’t like this. References to HR. They are dealt with in different parts, we want consistency. #NotBigFansOfHumanRights. They want a reference to developing countries take pre-2020 action. They don’t want any carbon pricing.



Panama (Rainforest Group)
: Set global goal to 1.5deg. text is good foundation. but need to refine some key elements ie tropical forests. Represent 39% of population. So need to anchor REDD+ in 3bis. To summarise no reason why we can’t implement REDD+ here in Paris. As CAN recently stated. Important to include REDD+.

Saint Lucia
: Endorse statements by G77, AOSIS, etc. On LTG -- strong support for 2 degrees. Only option for us is 1.5deg. This is RED LINE. References to SIDS references have been bracketed -- they should be as they have a unique place in this agreement. Issues around capacity.

Malaysia (LMDC’s):
70% of the worlds poor. Support G77. Text must be balanced as everyone seems unhappy. Mitigation weighted heavily. You leading the negotiations is a good sign. Suffering through the long hours with us will be good. I like that.

Proactive process is needed. Hope some mechanism to reflect the gist of positions of all parties. Other concerns on comments this evening. Reference to NDMC what is this alien creature? We know INDC not NDMC.



The provisions in 2bis can not be accepted. The provision that encapsulates CBDR in A3 shouldn’t there -- this a big issue. They want to remind their partners that they have been dealing with climate change.  They have issues with worksteam 2 on the ambition -- with some countries not willing to take further ambition. There is a link between W2 and W1. We cannot do away with CBDR. We will not do that. You have been warned. The convention must be followed. At the end of the day you sir will be responsible for ensuring climate justice.

Belize
:  Supports the ambition the vulnerable countries -- and in 2.1, 1.5 degrees should be there. They support human rights. Now is time for ministers to act by themselves.  The agreement must ensure adequate response to the issue.

Ecuador
: They endorse G77. Need to acknowledge importance this meeting. After 4 years we have a draft agreement. This meeting can’t forget about the issues of survival. There must be a binding agreement that acknowledges climate justice. This agreement must be legally binding in nature. They want climate justice in the agreement but it is not in their. Their must be the human rights.

India
: They support G77. There are still many points of depature. The agreement must be balanced between ambition and CBDR, cannot have one without the other. It needs to be reaffirmed up front it is under the convention across all pillars. The agreement must operationalize differentiation across all articles. Differentiation is not clear in the draft. The INDC’s is a great innovation -- with a focus on mitigation. It is also about all other articles as well though. On LTG -- they are sensitive on high climate ambition -- but they don’t want to see 1.5 degrees in the agreement because it would affect developing nations. The transparency agreement should cover all countries. On finance they are concerned developed nations are not meeting their requirements -- and there are issues around developed countries not scaling up. They want lifestyles and climate justice in the text.

Nigeria
: Support Africa and G77. Concerns LTG to be 1.5deg. Welcome preamble that says sus dev but wants a clear reference to the goals. They want Africa with SIDS and LDCs in text.
Leaders called for ambition. THe world has extremely high expectations and we will work to achieve these. .

Colombia:
They are pleased to hear the support for the text. They want the agreement to be ambitious, transparent and involve all parties. Calling on the agreement not to leave anyone behind. Mechanism for ambition for periodic review. all countries should present by 2021. Adaptation need high level segment and registry for commitments. They support LDC’s on the need to promote compliance in A11if it lacks this then the agreement will lack clarity on implementation. Can progress tonight on Temp goal, also need QUANTIFIED long term temp goal. Work can be done on A2 etc.. There must be predictability of post 2020 finance. Agree with process proposals for next couple of days. It’s in your hands and all our hands to make usre we reach agreement.

They support the process.

Venezuela
: Endorse G77, and LMDC’s. In her experience this conference has been good and wants to make a comment on human error intergenerational equity has been lost. They want to apologise for this being lost. #GivingEveryoneAHeartAttack. They have some suggestions on process -- want to stay together instead of splitting into two. They want a legal agreement to keep temp under 1.5.  -- and they are concerned the INDC’s lead us to over 3 degrees. They can’t #PullTheWool over people’s eyes when the deal hasn’t matched the ambition that is required. They disagree with carbon markets and rich countries buying the right to pollute. As ALBA they have text to deal with the cooperative approaches. They this to lead to a good result. In terms of carbon price -- it can be seen in the text -- they don’t support this and thought this had been removed. I don’t know how it got in there. Must be a powerful lobby behind this. For her country to move some arguments they want to put articles in 24 and it not to be sent to legal group. I want to be able to go home and tell my daugters that you are going to be fine. I think we can all agree with that.


Indonesia
: Support G77. The text is good -- but they have some issues. Climate change has affected indigenous people, they support the inclusion of this, plus human rights. They want to refer to the rights of indigenous people. They are worried that it has been removed from the preamble. They want a strong political signal on REDD+ and clarity that it is the best policy approach to stop deforestation. The support 2 degrees -- and they do support peaking of emissions. There should be post 2020 financing.

Japan
:The balance has been lost on ambition and differentiation. Effective and early implementation of the agreement. They request space for discussion on article 18.

Belarus:
Sometimes their voice is not heard. They want to see CBDR on national goals -- and support turkey and ukraine's statements. They are open to work

El Savador
: Endorse G77. Like indaba meetings. Concerned about vulnerability. We sent a report asking for agreement to recognise Central american Isthmus as reported in IPPC AR5. Hope that this happens.

Georgia
: They support the work of the facilitators. They support the provon support for low lying states. Differentiation is needed across the agreement. Transparency and accountability are important. Clear accounting is interest of all parties -- especially developing countries.

Philippines
: #Howdoesthisthingworkagain *Struggles with mic*

Support option 3 in A2 but open as long as No OPTION1.Option 1 is not an option.
Mitigation goal for full decarbonisation by 2050. Strong language on HR, women and indeginous rights. Needs to be in A2 as well as preamble. Pp11 needs stronger language not
noting
but
ensuring
. All ecosystems need to be referenced in the text. More work around rest of text. Pre and post 2020 finance is important. On L&D they find it vitally important to institutionalise Warsaw mechanism. They want the Press to continue the good work and want to work within the parties to work on text.

PNG
: Process question. Support CARICUM and Panama. The have a problem with where they work to finalise REDD+ mechanism?

*Straight to the point*

Bolivia:
Endorse G77 and LMDC. We see a few problems. Key issue on temperature. If we don’t look at 1.5 we may head for disaster. If with 1deg we have bad impacts with 2 deg the thought is unimaginable. Need to stay underneath 1.5deg! Mother Earth is important to include in the text. Work on CBDR, keeping historical contributions in mind. They want to voice the proposal of indigenous people and their tribunal on climate justice
. Wants a system of monitoring, compliance & that ensures climate justice.

They want to voice an issue of markets vs non-markets. They find the agreement leans to the side of markets. They don’t want a carbon market.

Nicaragua
: Supports G77, AOSIS, LMDC, Caricum. Won’t accept more than 1.5deg. They demand compensation of historic responsibilities. They are concerned CBDR doesn’t appear in the text.

Morocco:
They want to align themselves with G77 etc. In general agreement and decision must align. Need to limit temp well below 2deg (Not clear which option they support). Want to ensure CBDR. The agreement must bring to forefront support for developing countries of mitigation to adaptationadaptation. They need financing to reach the level of ambition -- developed countries must provide this support. The vunerable of ecosystems and social structures need to be recognised. In conclusion they support the inclusion of oceans etc.

*They speak fast in Morocco!*

Vietnam: T
hey support G&&. Need CBDR, support including gender equality and empowerment of women. Article 5 -- the request a separate agreement on L&D. Developed countries must take lead to provide support and finance. They are concerned how they can proceed when there are still so many brackets.

Pres:
You’re quite right.

Israel:
Endorse Umbrella.

Non annex 1 OECD country. Support increase transparency and accounting. Need a unified framework with built in flexibility. A11 req rclarity.

Azerbaijan
: They want the views of all the Parties to be into the text -- they want to thank the Pres for his process. Having said that their delegation is small and they’re not a part of any group. They have approached the co-facilitators and have a little bit of success.


Dominican Republic:
Support G77, Rainforest group. They are hopeful. Need to include education in agreement. All constituencies need to be represented. It’s time get rid of brackets. Gender equality needs to be a part of preamble. Any climate agreement all people are affected which is why we need to acknowledge this. Forests are an important element of this agreement. A strong signal must be sent that REDD+ needs to be get to work. Reinforces that everyone needs to be included.


Bhutan
: Supports G77 statement. Appreciate Pres’s process. The capacity of LDC’s in 4.9 have been diminished in the operative text -- around ease of access -- ie to finance for action plans. These texts need to be back. They call for LTG to be below 1.5 degrees. The treatment of vulnerable countries must be clear -- and this must include reference to mountainous area. No Party should be left behind.

Palau
: Supports G77 statement etc. New text is helpful but leaves aspects out -- such as ambition and climate justice. The 1.5 limit must be there. A clear target is needed to operationalise target with 5 year cycles. Must include L&D in separate article.

Nepal
: Support G77 etc. Welcomes draft text. Satisfied most of content. This draft is good basis for reaching destination. Like to see robust ambitious legally binding and durable greement here. Re Art 2: option 3 of para 1a - hold global average temperature rise to 1.5C below pre industrial levels. They want L&D in separate article. Mountain ecosystems are important. They are worried about rising temperature and melting glaciers. And loss of lives and livelihood of people in mountains. We would like to see our suggestions in the draft text, happy to work with parties to do so.

Pakistan:
They appreciate the work that’s been done. They support G77 etc.
Supports statements made on forests and include ecosystems. REDD+ is needed and is complete and ready to be implemented. No one wants to leave Paris without REDD+

Mali
: Supports G77 statements etc. in the preamble they want specific reference to UNFCCC. They want 1.5 degrees limit with differentiation reflected in the text. Developed countries must provide support. In conclusion they will work within the groups the belong.

Guinea
: Thanks the Pres for progress made. They are in agreement of G77 etc. They echo statements of Egypt + Nigeria + Morocco. Document good basis for work but needs to be mor
precise, clearer, more ambitious. Particularly re adaptation, l&D, financing, with priority access to countries w
lowest capacity. In order to achieve differentiation, we wish Africa and most vulnerable countries to be mentioned every other time vulnerable countries are mentioned. They want an African initiative to deliver support. Call on developed countries to provide financial assistance as subsidy of this sector which is of such importance to mitigation and adaptation.
Guinea commit to sparing no effort in order that this effort is a success.



***11 speakers left***
I want to close the list.
We need to save time to work through the night :)
But it’s getting Longer?


Mexico
: Endorse EIG. Trust that text is legit and transparent, brings us closer; has suggestions from all parties plus brings us close to solutions but only if we choose options that strengthen the agreement. Important issues for us: language relating to HR and gender equality. We are encouraged to see it in para 10 in spite of it not in A2. Must bear in mind that implementation should never exacerbate inequality. They want HR in adaptation. People’s wellbeing and the environment -- Inherent link between wellbeing & environment. HR is the best way to show(?) this link, Environmentally sound tech is important. A17 is needed -- wants it re-inserted. All Parties come forward with commitments.

Tanzania
: Thanks Pres for its efforts.  Supports G77 statement. Issues to be solved -- the agreement should be based on by convention. In this context the provisions need to be inline with this. Need to ensure means of impl. A6. should be consistent, predictable and adequate. Still some work ahead. Pp10 support indigenous, health, developmental, disability language. Not in favour of sweeping term for HR. THis could be used as barrier to means of implementation. 3Bis is good as it keep REDD+ -- and the support its implementation.

Cook Islands
: supports G77, AOSIS. Need to stay below 1.5deg. L&D must be separate and distinct! Concerned no special reference to SIDS and LDCs. It’s about simple access to support.

Cameroon
: Supports of Rainforest Nation and Egypt statements. The text takes the work of REDD+ forward. The text must reflect progress on REDD+ made in the last 10 years.
Any agreement without REDD+ will be incomplete. Should remain integral in A3bis. They look forward to continued work.

Timor Leste
: Wants to express sympathy for the burden you have here. Not sure if anyone else remembers but you used to be President at only 38yrs of age! Statements from LMC and small Island states must be recognised. Promises to nominate Pres for Nobel Peace Prize is he does this. L & D must be recognised.



President
: Thank You, I was blushing so hard that I could barely recognise myself



Norway:
A strong agreement needs a long term goal. Norway supports the agreement to accept human rights and other constituency text. Such as Intergenerational Equity. Me and my colleagues are prepared to work. Let's go to work!



Canada
: Agree that we need an ambitious agreement. They want an agreement that  is applicable to all, has mitigation that support long term goal, support adaptation with finance, and they will support countries in need. It is critically important that the agreement represents human rights. The preambular language must be pulled out of brackets.

South Sudan:
Latest draft text is way better, but we can improve. Endorse G77 etc. The text must reflect convention in fulliness. In accordance with the science the agreement should keep the temperature below 1.5 degrees. Mitigation must be greater. The agreement should provide for an enhanced means of implementation. The major departure is that post 202 fianance is secured. Developing countries shouldn’t foot the bill. We cannot allow planet earth to be destroyed and humans to become extinct like the dinosaurs. It is our collective and moral obligation.



DRC
: Supports G77 statement etc. The process has been helpful. An agreement must be legally binding and in accordance with the convention. Include REDD+. **Lots of superfluous statements.**

Samoa:
Joins unanimous thank yous. Thank you, thank you. Need to hold to 1.5deg. We are all vulnerable to CC but some are more vulnerable than others. We are negotiating a climate agreement not a financial or trade agreement. We should be open minded.



Algeria:
Endorses G77, African, Arab, LMDCs. Some parts could be improved. Need to find more compromise. Solutions to thorny issues mentioned at the start need to be found. We know your wisdom and common sense is up to the challenge. Need to ensure CBDR.

President
: Thank you my dear friend.

Bangladesh
: G77, LDC, SIDS. In long run mitigation is best adaptation so support 1.5deg. Strongly in favour of special support for SIDS.

Tuvalu
: Supports Angola etc. They ask for the floor to reaffirm their previous statements. They will reserve their specific textual statements till later.

Haiti
: Support AOSIS, G77. Support 1.5deg. This is RED LINE to ensure survival of SIDS. Each year his country is affected by the effects of climate change. Urgent action is needed for the simple reason that it is clear that any delay will morgage of my country -- which used to be the pearl of the caribbean. L&D must be included in the agreement.

Peru
: Concerns on access for observer organisation, LTG, transparency. Food security is important issue. Must remain ref to indigenous peoples. *Speaking on behalf of a lot of constituencies to support various language in the text ie women, indigenous, research, industry…*

Pres
: Given al
l the worked needed -- we must keep working. Will do an indaba on differentiation, ambition and implementation. In separate room L&D, Cooperative mechanisms., preamble, forests.
Compromise is needed. Then tomorrow morning we will work on it again and present a new improved text, the penultimate text! Hopefully at beginning of afternoon.

Now just need to sort out formalities. So prob meet again at midnight?

Secretariat
: Le Rhone for 1st group. Le Maroni for 2nd group. Secondary badges needed, 4 badges for each party. Will be a viewing room, to be announced, for parties only…:(

President
: When we talk about the Champs Elysee we mean here not in Paris. Just to make sure…

Japan
: We have some requests.

President
: For specific proposals see me in my office ;)
And with that meeting adjourned and see you at midnight.
