Developing nations are increasing their obligations under the convention, but they recognise it is difficult to increase ambition. The proposed bridging can be done through:

They reject that some countries don’t even want to make certain financial commitments. On climate finance the world is still the same. When it comes to effective mitigation countries are still not taking the action required if we look at INDC’s. Differentiation and equity are key. This is about a binding agreement not collaboration.

You created the problem but now say we should share responsibility on an equal basis. You acknowledge historical responsibility and differentiation but still won’t take action on this basis. Points out that the finance commitment has not been realised. All that is required now is for us to reduce our emissions and cut back on our industrialization conditional on support with means of implementation. Points out that civil society has done a reviews that are useful including ActionAid, ChristianAid, Friends of the Earth showing that developing countries are doing their fair share whereas developed countries are not meeting their obligations. In every thematic area there is no sincerity around differentiation and means of implementation. The challenge EU statements on self differentiation as it doesn’t meet equity. They are making very strong redlines on this differentiation and countries not taking their responsibility and this hard truth. You only deal with it through bracket. They want obligations that are much stronger and binding. Strongly and passionately advocating for differentiation. Intervention ends with applause.

Legal form: We are of the view that we need a legally binding agreement, but in naming an agreement legally binding we may end in some legal issues for some countries but not all. Transparency: We have a very transparent system with ICA. In complying with differentiation we don’t think there should be a unique transparency system for different countries.

Unless we start engaging in the text we are not adding value. Calls on chair to add structure to the conversation. Definitely not advocating for no differentiation. Advocating for more differentiation not less. At the moment we have 180 forms of differentiation. On transparency we are advocating for flexibility but is wide ranging. Worried if some parties think that others are advocating for one size fits all as hasn’t heard anyone say this. Rejects that all countries have failed under KP first commitment period.

    : As reflections on the meeting they see that all parties have spoken in a view of differentiation and that they feel no one size fit all. Make the point that differentiation is already in text, so the question is how do we communicate this up the chain. What value can we get out of that? All parties have spoken about making the greatest ambition so far. INDCs are great example of this. We note that all parties need support. In the context of our commitments they say they have met their targets under KP1 and will meet their commitments under KP2. They say that we’re on track to meeting the $100b goal.

Mitigation: They find it important which is why they have committed to reducing emissions. If differentiation is clearly made in the article 3 then we need to pull it right across the agreement. They see the regime should be flexible for MRV and transparent. Last element, adaptation: each country has a responsibility to it’s citizens to adapt and poorer people suffer the most which is why equity is important.

    : Clearly mitigation efforts by annex 1 countries will not be enough. System of self differentiation in form of INDC worked. The annexes no longer match the realities of the present. On mitigation as it’s proved through the INDC’s it’s showing there is differentiation between contributions. INDCs should not be entirely conditional to support but partly is OK. Vulnerable countries should have support. On transparency: reporting on contributions is very important, which it should be applicable to all.

    Not much achieved here. Everyone acknowledged the need for differentiation but differed in the way differentiation language should be used in the text, still no way forward on how to operationalise differentiation. No parties changed their positions from what was expected. Many developed countries questioned the value of the 3hr meeting as most time was used just repeating same message.

    : Concern about reports of non-flexibility. They’ve been making bridging proposals across the week. Thinks there is political will to make agreement on all issues. Up to 2020 and beyond they are committed to $100b. They want a ratchet mechanism that can increase ambition post 2020. They want a long term goal. On the question of differentiation we accept it and we are acting on it. EU accepts that there will be differentiation in different forms in different parts of the text. The trouble they are having is coming to a single conclusion on a specific piece of text around differentiation. Negotiations are very multifaceted and no-one can grasp all aspects at the same time this is causing the pace to be so slow. There needs to be a package of text rather than single text propositions. Need to move beyond a blame game. We have shown flexibility and believe other parties have too but need a step change in process. #Micdrop

    Not only one who feels real emotion around this. This agreement is result of 4yrs of hard work. This is a positive outcome -- but we need to write the next page together. Thanks Co-facilitators of ADP. Everyone has accepted to step aside national interests in the interest of the collective efforts. Thanks to the commitments of all the parties. Ownership is collective -- and this is a great achievement. Don’t have a plan B and don’t need a plan B. We now have a basis.This text demonstrates the will of all -- and agreement that is for all -- but more needs to be obviously to be done. To achieve a final result we will have to continue to keep working. Nothing is decided but we have a text that allows us to move forward -- nothing is decided until everything has been decided. The next days will not be leap into the unknown, it will be transparent and no country will be left out of the discussion. Listening to China’s statement she couldn’t help think that there is some sort of other name they were suggesting. Real sense of optimism now at COP21. This will carry us forward to achieve what we want to achieve.

    They are willing to continue work on the new text and bridging proposals. We must remain focused on what we agreed in Durban. The want to reemphasis that the Paris outcome must be under the convention and must not try to rewrite the convention. Core elements mitigation, adaptation, L&amp;D, finance, tech dev and transfer etc…..Adaptation and L&amp;D must be given same weight as mitigation. They believe there is a strong text to forward -- but more work needs to be done. Much more work needs to be done to fulfill mandate of the COP. In the words of Nelson Mandela: It always seems impossible until it happens. It is in our hands. They call on the parties to deal with issues they have. They say they can not afford to talk more on process.

Here in paris we have unique opportunity to secure the future for generations to come. We must deliver on the collective effort. Net zero emissions as the LTG with finance. Every 5 years we must review our action. In particular a collective target of finance is needed from developed nations. An equitable and fair agreement must include L&amp;D -- including institutional arrangements -- with post 2020 ambition should be fortified because of the ambition gap especially on mitigation. Unity and persistence is what we must hold firmly. Trust is needed. CBDR must be at the center of this agreement. AILAC is ready to move forward with bridge building proposals.

    Lots of work from today, with open meetings. Talking about the process as transparent. Since Sunday there has been an 2 open session, also had bilaterals with various parties. Some headway was made. A better under of climate finance has been developed on article 6b has developed, growing convergence. Discussion covered both consultation of covered general topics and specifics of article 6, plus the decision. Issues included , provision of support, mobilisation, climate finance scale and scaling up and provision support. Common ground is being found on provision support climate finance with flexibility with developed countries making commitments under the convention. Various parties had text proposal including how possible other parties could be captured in the decision. Vol contributions, and those willing and able to do so, and south-south collaboration. Parties also spoke of collaborative element of climate finance, however some Parties have been very reserved about their commitments to the convention.  Another issue scale and scaling up. In general there is agreement to address notion within agreement. In general there is agreement to address this problem -- but how this is implemented is still under discussion.

    : A plenary session on the L6 version of the text -- with many countries attending. Differentiation is important across the whole agreement and for all countries to be a part of the agreement. Key innovation which has boosted this area is the INDCs bottom up approach has allowed all parties to operationalise diff and allows ratchet up over time. Concepts of notion of travel and assurances of no backsliding resonated very strongly. Developed countries assured they would continue to take the lead. Taking into account countries own circumstances would help some parties accept this differentiation in the agreement. Article 2/2bis and 3. Some debate on applicability of 2bis but key point was that there has to be a balance emphasis on differentiation/support.

    me want 1.5deg and others still sticking to 2deg. Contextualisation for long term goal are still unclear. Long term goals of mitigation are being called for -- with many calls for climate neutrality and decarbonisation, and zero carbon by end of the century. Some called for zero emissions in 2nd half of century. Some parties wanted this as part of the temperature target. Some discussion about how this needs to be linked with quality science.Seems to be convergence towards 5  year period of the review and as a global moment.

    : Progress made on workstream 2, but many issues remain. Many brackets were removed last week. Focus on accelerated on implementation has been our focus. Bilaterals were conducted today -- which will finish this night. Pre-2020 coverage. All recognise the need for implementation of all parties. There is common ground on a technique process on adaptation. Parties agreed that technical process on mitigation has been a success and could be a model for adaptation. On accelerated implementation: Facilitative dialogue would be comprehensive with all parties -- but with a focus on developing countries. These elements are not agreed and nothing is accepted. Some key elements still to be decided, will work on tomorrow and present final findings tomorrow.

    They want to suggest after the bilaterals and the feedback that has been given on co-facilitators -- the next stage should be a reality check that the comments capture the balance of the comments. Being human the would like to suggest that the comments should be brought back to the groups for reflection. They want a process tomorrow of a group to reflect on actual text based discussion and a more inclusive process. Change mode -- some level of text based negotiations as we have built shared understanding through bilaterals.

On A3 all aspects were covered -- with parties proposing text. Streaming has been done on A6. Concrete textual proposes have been made -- but work needs to be done and they can not be seen as agreed text. Parties have found coverance on A7 + decisions. A lot of progress has been made on a number of the articles. There are still some outstanding issues around capacity building and A8.5, plus differentiation in 8.5 &amp; 8.4.

   <span>
    : A number of consultations have been made. This afternoon there has been a ministerial, with two meetings, long term goal and Xxx. Discussions have been cooperative. On the Long Term Temp goal -- most parties want the 1.5 in the text in the purpose. They want accompanying statements around food security and sustainable development. On global mitigation goal. 2 main strategies. 1st quantitative elements with short/medium/long. 2nd option is Long term qualitative goal. These need to be operational. There should be a global aggregate stocktake -- which must not impinge on national decision making. 5 year cycle agreed by most parties.  Issue remain with starting years and placement.

    The aim of the text is to enable us to have an overview of the progress made -- and the issues that need to be settled at the political level. This is not the final text. It might contain elements that Parties might not find accepted. 29 pages long text. 3 quarters of the brackets have been removed. There has been consensus on mitigation and adaptation capacity building. Almost concluded on adaptation. Lets us focus on L&amp;D and views closer on this. Also closer on transparency framework. Progress on development and transfer of tech. Some progress on forests and preamble. Certain political issues remain and they are now clear. 3 issues are: Differentiation, finance and level of the ambition of the agreement. On these issues countries will scale up their work. We have tried to put out clearer options. We must all together make these crucial choices and agree on compromises. Progress has been made -- but work needs to be done. The best solution the Pre

Let us unite! but also find compromises.  See you all at 8pm tonight with your working caps on.

    Differentiation, fiance and ambition.  Is making a proposal about the ongoing work: An hour should be put aside to discuss and maybe even a grab bite to eat if you can. Then another meeting in an Indaba format. Focus on three key issues above. For conference to be success we need to solve these issues! Progress has been made but still not far enough. Many parties will say there aren’t many of us so I propose 3 key meetings without having 6 or so meetings which the smaller delegations couldn’t cover. The aim is to come back tomorrow with another version of the text after discussions from tonight. In the coming hours Pres asks not reopen issues -- but work on the political issues to be resolved. Under our rules we have to bear in mind delays for checking at legal and linguistic levels. Some articles are clean so the Pres is asking the translators to do the work needed to start translating the text.Now open the floor but please be brief.

    Concern about the agreement diverging away from the convention. Framing of many parties positions are not clearly differentiated. Numerous issues between the convention language and the text around differentiation; ie Adaptation. In means of implementation -- the group doesn’t see the assurances supported in the post 2020 period. Says there is no long term commitment on finance with scalable funds. Issues around finance tech transfer and capacity building. On capacity building concern with lack of differentiation. Agree there should be separate article on L&amp;D There needs to be a permanent institution to deal with loss and damage.Concern with diverging from convention again.

    Clear and operational manner. Strong preference of A2 1 (A)(3). Clarity on long term goal with quantitative approach for mid century and beyond. Mitigations -- prefer quantitative approach (opt1) . 2.3 to ensure no backsliding on INDC and NDC’s. More work is need on 3.2 and is happy to be engaged on this. On Adaptation there needs to be a link with Mitigation in accordance with CBDR. Loss and damage should remain separate (A5).  On finance the special circumstances of SIDS needs to be dealt with. The special needs of finance commitments of SIDS. There needs to be operationalising of MRV. Finally on workstream 2. Generally pleased only minor drafting issues. Very little time left and we’re ready to get down to work!

    Will explore options of 2 and 3 in A2 (1). Preference for option 3 (1.5deg). It is not sympathy they are looking for. Climate change threatens our way of life. They will not sign off on an agreement that will end in an extinction of our people.Special circumstances are REAL. This reality is NOT NEGOTIABLE. SIDS have specific challenges with access to finance + technology. It would be a grave injustice for that that are on the frontlines of climate change to now be threatened with such neglect in this text. We can not leave Paris without Loss and Damage. The compliance mechanisms are weak -- but welcome the 5 year stocktake. Thanks for the bridging text but this doesn’t anchor REDD+ in the agreement. This needs to be anchored as an agreed mechanism.

    : Some text moved to agreement. Key aspects now less binding and less durable. They need a bolder text on some key issues. Further iteration is needed. Many options cross our redlines. That means the Paris agreement would not be on track to achieve our objectives. The mitigation mechanism is not strong enough -- this will not keep us under 2 degrees. The bifurcated approach through the text. Aviation and shipping is not in text. After 2020 countries to do so should contribute to finance. In transport emissions have not been addressed. After 2020, countries in a position to do so should join finance. The approach for clear NDC’s has been lost. To summary we can;’t do line by line negotiation yet but will continue as you have propose.

They want to see a clear statement of the adaptation co-benefits that are coming in the form of mitigation. As far as the goal -- it has to be durable -- doesn’t like specific number in a goal -- ie wants it to be a lofy goal that doesn’t undermine sustainable development (count that as the development of oil). Needs to be durable. We want qualitative goal #boo. Who judges who is in position to help and who is not (On finance). In regard to the adaptation -- they want a registry so people know they are doing something. They are concerned that only 60 Parties need to sign it -- they don’t like this. References to HR. They are dealt with in different parts, we want consistency. #NotBigFansOfHumanRights. They want a reference to developing countries take pre-2020 action. They don’t want any carbon pricing.

They want to remind their partners that they have been dealing with climate change.  They have issues with worksteam 2 on the ambition -- with some countries not willing to take further ambition. There is a link between W2 and W1. We cannot do away with CBDR. We will not do that. You have been warned. The convention must be followed.

The INDC’s is a great innovation -- with a focus on mitigation. It is also about all other articles as well though. On LTG -- they are sensitive on high climate ambition -- but they don’t want to see 1.5 degrees in the agreement because it would affect developing nations. The transparency agreement should cover all countries. On finance they are concerned developed nations are not meeting their requirements -- and there are issues around developed countries not scaling up.

Re Art 2: option 3 of para 1a - hold global average temperature rise to 1.5C below pre industrial levels. They want L&amp;D in separate article. Mountain ecosystems are important. They are worried about rising temperature and melting glaciers. And loss of lives and livelihood of people in mountains.

    : Endorse EIG. Trust that text is legit and transparent, brings us closer; has suggestions from all parties plus brings us close to solutions but only if we choose options that strengthen the agreement. Important issues for us: language relating to HR and gender equality. We are encouraged to see it in para 10 in spite of it not in A2. Must bear in mind that implementation should never exacerbate inequality. They want HR in adaptation. People’s wellbeing and the environment -- Inherent link between wellbeing &amp; environment. HR is the best way to show(?) this link, Environmentally sound tech is important. A17 is needed -- wants it re-inserted. All Parties come forward with commitments.
